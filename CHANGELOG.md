## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **auth:** scoped service tokens whose scopes flow into policy checks (#1158).
  Mint named, optionally-expiring API tokens carrying a set of flat scopes
  (e.g. `posts:read`) via `IssueTokenSpec` + `issue_scoped_api_token`; tokens
  stay hashed at rest. The `ApiTokenStore` trait gains additive,
  default-implemented `issue_scoped` / `verify_scoped` / `list` / `rotate`
  methods (existing impls keep compiling), and the built-in `InMemoryApiTokenStore`
  / `DbApiTokenStore` record `last_used_at` and reject expired tokens (401).
  `PolicyContext` gains `has_scope` / `has_any_scope` / `has_all_scopes`
  mirroring the role accessors, populated from the authenticating token via the
  new `ApiTokenScopes` request extension and `authorize_with_scopes` /
  `PolicyContext::from_request_parts`. `#[secured(scopes = ["posts:write"])]`
  gates a handler on token scopes (default-deny, `403` when missing) and works
  for pure service principals with no session; `#[secured("admin", scopes = […])]`
  requires both. Management surface: helper API, `autumn token`
  (`issue --name/--scope/--expires-at`, `list`, `rotate`), and an
  `autumn-admin-plugin` `TokenAdminModel` panel. Additive `api_tokens` columns
  (`name`, `scopes` JSONB, `expires_at`, `last_used_at`) via a new framework
  migration; minor version bump, no breaking change to `autumn-web`.
- **cli:** `autumn generate tauri` — scaffolds a complete `src-tauri/` sidecar
  project so any existing autumn app ships as a native desktop installer with a
  single additional command (`cargo tauri build`). Uses the Tauri v2 sidecar
  model: the autumn server binary is supervised by the Tauri shell and the
  webview loads from an ephemeral loopback port chosen at runtime. Fully
  self-contained at runtime via managed local Postgres (#1119,
  `managed-pg-bundled`) and single-binary asset embedding (#1004,
  `embed-assets`). Generator is purely additive — never rewrites your app's
  `src/main.rs` or root `Cargo.toml`. Idempotent, dry-run capable, prints
  required external prerequisites after scaffolding (#1150).
- **ui:** reusable Maud pagination-nav renderer — `autumn_web::ui::pagination::{pagination_nav, cursor_pagination_nav, PagerOptions}`,
  re-exported from the prelude. Renders an accessible (`<nav>` with
  `aria-current="page"` and non-focusable disabled prev/next), filter-preserving
  (keeps the current query string, swapping only the `page`/`size` params),
  htmx-opt-in, windowed pager (`1 … 4 5 6 … 20`) from an existing `Page`, plus a
  cursor variant for `CursorPage` feeds. The admin plugin's two hand-rolled
  pagers (`render_pagination`, `jobs_pagination`) now call the shared helper,
  removing the duplicated page-window logic (#1007).
- **ci:** feature-combination compile gate covering 35 `autumn-web` feature
  combinations — each individual flag in isolation (`cargo hack --each-feature`)
  plus curated real-world combos (`db`, `mail`, `maud,htmx`, `storage,db`,
  `telemetry-otlp`) — so downstream apps building with a trimmed feature set
  can't silently break between releases (#982).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added


- **daemon:** `autumn serve` — run an app as a production (non-watch) local
  daemon, with an optional managed local Postgres (#1119)
  - `autumn serve` runs the compiled app in the foreground as a production
    server (distinct from `autumn dev`: no file watching or hot reload).
    `--release` builds an optimized binary.
  - `autumn serve --daemon` backgrounds the server under a PID lockfile (a
    second start is rejected with a clear message instead of double-binding);
    `autumn serve stop | status | restart` manage its lifecycle. Graceful
    shutdown reuses the existing lame-duck drain via `SIGTERM`.
  - The server binds a **Unix domain socket** (new `server.unix_socket` /
    `AUTUMN_SERVER__UNIX_SOCKET`) — never a public interface by default — and
    the chosen address is written to a discovery file for clients. PID, socket,
    address file, and logs live under platform dirs (XDG / `%APPDATA%`), never
    cwd or `/etc`.
  - `autumn new --daemon` scaffolds a model-free starter that builds with **no
    Postgres** (drops the `db` feature and migrations) — runnable as a daemon
    with zero external dependencies.
  - `ManagedPostgresPoolProvider` (feature `managed-pg`) provisions and
    supervises a local Postgres in the app's data dir through the existing
    `with_pool_provider` seam (no query-path changes); `managed-pg-bundled`
    embeds the Postgres binaries in the app executable. `autumn new
    --bundled-pg` scaffolds and wires it.

- **sharding:** `from_shard(db: &ShardedDb) -> Self` constructor on generated
  repositories (#1273)
  - `#[repository]` now emits `from_shard` as the standard way to build a
    repository over a shard while preserving full request instrumentation:
    statement timeout, slow-query threshold, and shard-tagged route metric
    label are all carried from the `ShardedDb` context rather than reset to
    framework defaults.
  - The previous `with_pool` constructor is **renamed** to
    `with_pool_untracked` to signal at the call site that request
    observability is bypassed. Uses of `with_pool` on generated repositories
    must be updated to `with_pool_untracked` (only the name changes; the
    signature and semantics are identical).
  - `ShardedDb` gains a `#[doc(hidden)]` `__autumn_repository_seed()` accessor
    exposing the `ShardRepositorySeed` carrier struct used by generated code.

- **middleware:** `AppBuilder::static_gate` — auth gating for SSG/ISG routes
  via a pre-static middleware hook (#848)
  - Cached SSG/ISG pages are served by the static-first middleware before the
    inner router (session, auth) is reached, so framework auth layers could not
    gate pre-rendered responses. `static_gate` registers a Tower layer that runs
    **outermost** — outside the session layer and ahead of the static cache —
    so it can redirect or reject a request before a cached page is served
    (Autumn's analogue of Next.js Edge Middleware).
  - Runs in the same outermost position in both SSG/ISG and fully-dynamic
    modes, so gating code is portable. Has access to request headers/cookies but
    **not** the session `Extension` (verify a signed/JWT cookie directly).
  - Plugin pre-flight helpers `has_static_gate::<L>()` /
    `get_static_gate_types()`, and a matching `TestApp::static_gate` for tests.
  - Additive only; documented in `docs/guide/middleware.md`.
- **db:** Declarative associations and eager loading for `#[model]` / `#[repository]` (#835)
  - `#[model]` accepts struct-level `#[belongs_to(Target, fk = ...)]`,
    `#[has_many(Target, fk = ...)]`, and `#[has_one(Target, fk = ...)]`.
    Foreign keys are inferred by convention (`belongs_to` → `{target}_id` on
    this model; `has_many`/`has_one` → `{source}_id` on the target) and
    overridable with `fk = …`. The accessor/store name is derived by
    convention and overridable with `name = …`, so multiple associations can
    target the same model (e.g. `authored` / `approved` both → `Post`) without
    colliding. The schema and association set live in one place — no per-pair
    `Related` impl.
  - Codegen emits a `{Model}Preload` spec builder (`Model::preload()`), a
    `{Model}Associations` accessor trait implemented for `Preloaded<Model>`,
    and a `Preloadable` impl that issues the batched queries.
  - `#[repository]` gains `preload(records, spec)` returning
    `Vec<Preloaded<Model>>`. It issues **at most one** `WHERE ... IN (...)`
    statement per association per level (`belongs_to`/`has_one` keyed on the
    parent/target id; `has_many` grouped client-side), with **no** per-row
    fetches and **no** implicit lazy loading. Nested paths are supported, e.g.
    `Post::preload().author().comments_with(Comment::preload().author())`.
  - New `autumn_web::preload` module: `Preloaded<T>` (derefs to the record),
    the type-erased `Associations` store, the typed `NotLoaded` accessor error
    (accessing an un-preloaded association is an error, never SQL), the
    `Preloadable` trait, and the `impl_preloadable_leaf!` macro for
    hand-written association targets.
  - Preload SQL runs on the **same read role** as the parent finder (the
    repository's snapshotted `ReadRoute`); `on_primary()` pins the whole chain.
    With `CursorPage`, preloads execute **after** the overfetch/truncate.
  - Preloaded associations honor the target's **read scoping**, keyed off the
    target's `#[repository]` config (not field presence): when the target
    repository is `soft_delete`, soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`)
    are hidden; when it is `tenant_scoped`, rows outside the ambient
    `CURRENT_TENANT` are hidden — mirroring the target's finders. A
    `deleted_at`/`tenant_id` column on a model whose repository does *not* opt
    in is left unfiltered. `repo.across_tenants().preload(...)` skips the
    tenant predicate at every level, matching `across_tenants()` finders.
  - `examples/reddit-clone` migrated: the front page and single-post view drop
    their hand-written joins / per-row author lookups for `preload`. See
    `docs/adr/0008-associations-and-eager-loading.md`.
- **db:** Framework-native horizontal sharding (`[[database.shards]]`)
  - Tenant data routes key → logical slot (fixed at 16384 slots, matching
    Redis Cluster/Valkey — nothing to choose or outgrow; deterministic
    FNV-1a/splitmix64 hash pinned by golden-vector tests) → physical shard
    per an explicit `slots` map, so resharding moves whole slots in config
    instead of rehashing keys. Each shard is a full primary/replica
    `DatabaseTopology` with per-shard `replica_fallback`.
  - New `autumn_web::sharding` module and prelude extractors: `ShardedDb`
    (tenant-routed via `ShardKeyOverride` → tenancy task-local → tenant
    extraction; derefs like `Db` with the same `tx` semantics) and `Shards`
    (`db_for`/`read_for`/`db_on` plus a bounded concurrent `each_shard`
    fan-out that collects per-shard results — there are no cross-shard
    transactions). Pluggable `ShardRouter` via
    `AppBuilder::with_shard_router`; per-shard pool decoration via
    `DatabasePoolProvider::create_shard_topology`. `#[repository]` gains a
    `with_pool` constructor for shard-scoped repositories.
  - Startup auto-migrate and `autumn migrate` apply migrations control-first
    then per shard, fail-fast with target labels; new `--shard <name>` /
    `--control-only` flags and per-target `status`. Per-shard replica
    migration parity gates each shard's replica reads.
  - `/ready` and `/actuator/health` gain `db:shard:<name>` components;
    `/actuator/metrics` gains a `database_shards` block; shard-routed
    checkouts tag spans (`db.shard`) and route metrics (`shard=<name>`).
  - Framework state (jobs, scheduler locks, sessions, flags) stays on the
    unsharded control role — enforced at config validation. New
    `examples/bookmarks-sharded` Docker Compose stack and
    `docs/guide/sharding.md`.

- **auth:** Active session management with device list and revocation in the auth starter (#819)
  - `autumn generate auth` now persists a `{user}_sessions` row per login
    (SHA-256 digest of the opaque session id — never the raw id — plus user id,
    IP at login, raw + parsed User-Agent, optional device label, `created_at`,
    `last_seen_at`), created on password login, email confirmation, TOTP verify,
    and passkey login, and removed on logout.
  - Generated handler APIs on the user model: `sessions()`, `revoke_session(id)`,
    `revoke_other_sessions(current_digest)`, and `revoke_all_sessions()`, plus a
    `require_tracked_session` gate used by every generated authenticated route.
    The row is the source of truth: revoking it makes the device's **next**
    request 401 (the cookie session is destroyed too), with no reliance on
    cookie expiry. `last_seen_at` writes are throttled to at most one per
    `[auth.sessions].last_seen_update_secs` (default 60 s) per session.
  - New `/account/sessions` Maud + htmx page: per-session revoke buttons,
    device labels, and a one-click "Sign out everywhere else".
  - Credential-changing events — password reset, TOTP enrollment/disable, and
    passkey add/remove — revoke all *other* sessions by default, configurable
    via the new `[auth.sessions] revoke_on_credential_change` flag (default on).
  - New `autumn_web::user_agent` module: a dependency-free heuristic
    `parse_user_agent` (browser family / OS / device class) with a documented
    one-line swap point for custom parsers.
  - Generated `tests/auth_sessions.rs` covers the two-client flow (log in twice,
    revoke from one client, the other's replayed cookie 401s) and generated
    `docs/guide/session-management.md` documents the APIs, the privacy posture
    for stored IP/UA (purpose limitation, retention scrubbing SQL, IP
    truncation), and the migration path for existing auth-starter apps.
  - Additive only: one new table in the auth-starter migration; no public API
    removed.
- **jobs:** Job uniqueness keys and concurrency limits for `#[job]` (#829)
  - `#[job(unique)]` dedupes enqueues on a stable hash of the full args;
    `unique_by = "field, …"` derives the key from selected args fields. The
    uniqueness window is configurable: `unique_window = "running"` (default:
    held while pending or running), `"pending"` (released when execution
    starts), or `unique_for_ms = N` (TTL debounce from enqueue time). A
    coalesced enqueue is a no-op `Ok(())` — N identical enqueues in a burst
    execute exactly once.
  - `#[job(concurrency = N)]` caps simultaneously-executing jobs of the type;
    `concurrency_key = "field"` scopes the cap per distinct args value
    (e.g. at most one `recalculate_account` per account). Excess jobs wait
    for a slot rather than running or being dropped.
  - Enforced consistently on all three backends and distributed-safe on the
    durable ones: Postgres uses an additive schema (nullable columns + a
    partial unique index with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and concurrency-aware
    claims serialized by a transaction-scoped advisory lock only when a
    limited job is registered; Redis uses `SET NX PX` unique locks and atomic
    Lua claim/settle scripts with a parked-jobs zset.
  - Keys and slots are released on success, terminal failure, and worker
    crash (visibility-timeout recovery / TTL backstop), so a dead worker
    cannot deadlock a unique key or leak a concurrency slot. Retries keep
    the key held but free the slot during backoff.
  - Observability: `/actuator/jobs` adds `total_deduplicated` and
    `blocked_on_concurrency` per job, and the job admin model gains the
    `deduplicated` status.
  - Additive and non-breaking: jobs without the new attributes behave
    exactly as before; the `autumn_jobs` schema change is additive; minor
    version bump.

- **log:** Structured per-request access log, on by default (#999)
  - Every served HTTP request now emits **exactly one** structured access-log
    event (`tracing` target `autumn::access`, level `INFO`) at the response
    boundary, carrying `method`, `route` (the matched low-cardinality template,
    e.g. `/users/{id}` — never the raw path), `status`, `duration_ms`, and the
    `request_id` that matches the `x-request-id` header and error pages.
  - Dual placement: the **primary** layer emits inside the request
    span/log context (correlated, request id from the request extension) and
    marks the response; an **outermost fallback** at the router assembly
    boundary logs only responses the primary never saw — startup 503s,
    pre-built static (SSG/ISR) page hits, session-store outage 503s, and
    requests to the late-mounted MCP endpoint — with the wire status and no
    request id (those paths never run `RequestIdLayer`).
  - Rendered by the standard subscriber, so it honors `log.format`: a readable
    line under `pretty`, a single JSON object per line under `json`. Works with
    **no** `telemetry-otlp` feature and no OTLP collector — operators on
    `docker logs` / platform log drains get request-level visibility for free.
  - Steady-state probe/asset noise is excluded by default (`/health`,
    `/live`, `/ready`, `/startup`, `/actuator/*`, `/static/*`); the set is
    configurable via `log.access_log_exclude` (whole-segment prefix matching)
    or `AUTUMN_LOG__ACCESS_LOG_EXCLUDE` (comma-separated). Unmatched requests
    log the low-cardinality `_unmatched` route label.
  - On by default; turn off with `log.access_log = false` in `autumn.toml`
    or `AUTUMN_LOG__ACCESS_LOG=false` — no recompile needed.
  - The line never includes query strings, headers, or bodies, preserving the
    log-scrubbing posture established for logs (#697) by construction.
  - Additive `LogConfig` fields only (`access_log`, `access_log_exclude`);
    non-breaking, minor version bump.

- **log:** Request-scoped log context that auto-tags every log line (#1169)
  - An always-on `LogContextLayer` establishes a fresh `tokio::task_local`
    `log::context::LogContext` for **every** HTTP request, seeded with the same
    `request_id` used by the `x-request-id` header and error pages. It is not
    gated behind `telemetry-otlp` and is applied inner to `RequestIdLayer` so the
    request id is always available.
  - The request is driven inside a `tracing` span carrying
    `request_id`/`user_id`/`tenant_id`, so every `tracing` event emitted during
    the request automatically correlates back to it — no manual field threading.
  - When the request authenticates, `user_id` is added to the context
    automatically (from both the `#[secured]` session check and the `RequireAuth`
    middleware); when multi-tenancy resolves a tenant, `tenant_id` is added
    automatically (from the tenancy middleware).
  - Handler/service code can attach custom fields with
    `autumn_web::log::context::with_log_field("order_id", id)` (re-exported from
    the prelude). The well-known ids (`request_id`/`user_id`/`tenant_id`) ride the
    request span and render in ordinary `tracing` output; custom fields are
    carried in the context for **structured** consumers — the actuator log buffer
    (#1168), the access line (#999), or any context-aware layer — rather than the
    default stdout formatter. Reserved keys cannot be shadowed by custom fields.
  - The context stays active while a streaming/SSE response body is produced (the
    body is re-scoped per frame, mirroring tenancy), and synchronous work in a
    downstream layer's `Service::call` is correlated too.
  - Context is isolated per request (nothing leaks across requests) and a
    `tokio::spawn`'d task does **not** inherit it unless explicitly propagated via
    `log::context::in_current_context(..)`, which re-enters the request span too.
  - Sensitive custom-field values are scrubbed through the existing
    `log/filter.rs` key filter (#697), so secrets never enter the context output.
  - Additive, non-breaking surface (minor version bump). Establishes the
    correlating primitive consumed by the per-request access line (#999) and the
    actuator log-view buffer (#1168).
- **mcp:** Expose typed endpoints as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools so AI agents can call your API (#1117)
  - New `mcp` Cargo feature (implies `openapi`). `AppBuilder::mount_mcp("/mcp")` serves a spec-compliant MCP endpoint over Streamable HTTP, handling `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.
  - Endpoints opt in per-route via `#[api_doc(mcp)]`; nothing is exposed implicitly. `#[api_doc(mcp = false)]` force-excludes a route.
  - A whole-API hatch, `AppBuilder::expose_all_as_mcp()`, auto-includes every eligible `GET`, but mutating verbs (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) still require an explicit `#[api_doc(mcp)]` opt-in, and per-endpoint exclusions are always honored.
  - Each tool's `name`, `description`, and `inputSchema` are derived from the existing `ApiDoc` (operation id, summary/description, merged request-body + `Query` + path-param schemas) — there is no second, hand-maintained schema, so the tool catalog cannot drift from the handler's typed contract.
  - `tools/call` dispatches through the **real handler pipeline** (the same in-process path the test client uses), so `#[secured]`, authorization, tenancy, rate limits, and validation apply identically to an agent call and an HTTP call.
  - Agent authentication reuses the existing bearer-token surface (`RequireApiToken` / `ApiTokenStore`): the `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and `X-CSRF-Token` headers presented to `/mcp` are forwarded into the dispatched call, so bearer, session (`#[secured]`), and CSRF-protected routes behave identically to a direct request.
  - `Origin` validation (MCP Streamable-HTTP spec requirement) is enforced against the app's CORS `allowed_origins`: a browser `Origin` not in the allowlist gets `403`, while requests without an `Origin` (non-browser agents) pass — defending against DNS-rebinding without breaking agent clients.
  - `AppBuilder::secure_mcp(layer)` gates the entire `/mcp` endpoint (catalog included) behind any tower layer, e.g. `RequireApiToken`.
  - JSON-RPC robustness: rejects requests missing `jsonrpc: "2.0"`, empty/malformed batches, and non-object `arguments` with `-32600`/`-32602`; negotiates only supported protocol versions; enforces required `body` arguments; serializes array query fields with form/explode semantics; and reuses the framework path-segment encoder. Tool-result bodies are capped at 10 MiB. Duplicate tool names (same `operation_id`) keep the first registration with a build-time warning.
  - HTTP method maps to MCP safety annotations: `GET` → `readOnlyHint`; `DELETE` → `destructiveHint`.
  - Only JSON-in/JSON-out endpoints are eligible; HTML/Maud routes (no response schema) are auto-excluded with a build-time log note.
  - `examples/todo-app` gains an `/mcp` endpoint exposing `list_json` (read) and `create_json` (explicitly-opted-in write) behind `RequireApiToken`.

- **actuator:** Decouple the Prometheus scrape endpoint from sensitive mode (#857)
  - New `actuator.prometheus` config flag (default `true`) controls
    `/actuator/prometheus` **independently of** `actuator.sensitive`. Production
    apps can expose Prometheus metrics for platform scraping (e.g. Fly.io
    `[metrics]`) while keeping `sensitive = false`, so `/actuator/env`,
    `/actuator/configprops`, `/actuator/loggers`, `/actuator/tasks`,
    `/actuator/jobs`, and the actuator task UI stay off the public surface.
  - Set `actuator.prometheus = false` (or `AUTUMN_ACTUATOR__PROMETHEUS=false`)
    to remove the scrape endpoint entirely (it then returns `404`). The flag is
    surfaced in `/actuator/configprops`.
  - The `[actuator]` section now honors environment overrides
    (`AUTUMN_ACTUATOR__PREFIX`, `AUTUMN_ACTUATOR__SENSITIVE`,
    `AUTUMN_ACTUATOR__PROMETHEUS`), matching the documented
    `AUTUMN_SECTION__FIELD` convention. Previously the actuator section was only
    configurable via TOML.
  - Docs: `docs/guide/deployment.md` now describes the safe Fly.io deployment
    shape, including scraping a private/non-public metrics port, and clarifies
    that OTLP tracing and the Prometheus scrape endpoint are separate telemetry
    paths — enabling OTLP does not add OpenTelemetry metrics to
    `/actuator/prometheus` without an explicit bridge/exporter.
- **testing:** CSS-selector HTML assertions on `TestResponse` (#1147)
  - Autumn renders server-side HTML (Maud + htmx), so the in-process test client can now assert on page *structure* by CSS selector instead of brittle substrings. New chainable methods on `TestResponse`: `assert_selector(css)`, `assert_no_selector(css)`, `assert_selector_count(css, n)`, `assert_text(css, expected)`, `assert_text_contains(css, sub)`, and `assert_attr(css, attr, expected)`.
  - Non-asserting accessors for custom assertions: `selector_count(css) -> usize`, `selector_text(css) -> Vec<String>`, and `selector_attr(css, attr) -> Vec<Option<String>>` — each returns matches in document order.
  - Backed by a dependency-free HTML parser and CSS-selector matcher (`tag`, `.class`, `#id`, `[attr]`/`[attr=v]`/`[attr^=v]`/`[attr$=v]`/`[attr*=v]`, compound selectors, selector lists, and descendant/child combinators). Parses fragments literally, so bare `<tr>` htmx swaps are selectable — a spec HTML5 tree builder would foster-parent and drop them.
  - Assertions survive cosmetic template changes (whitespace, attribute order, wrapping markup) that break the equivalent `assert_body_contains` test. Failure messages print the selector, expected-vs-actual value, and a truncated outline of the parsed HTML.
  - Purely additive: no breaking change to existing assertions; no new published dependency. See the `autumn::test` module docs and `docs/guide/testing.md` for a worked example.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **dev inspector:** Built-in request inspector with N+1 query detection (#701)
  - In `dev` profile, `autumn-web` automatically mounts a request inspector UI at `/_autumn/inspect` (configurable via `[dev] inspector_path`). The route does not exist in `prod` or `test` profiles.
  - The inspector records the last N requests (default `N = 100`, configurable via `[dev] inspector_capacity`) in a bounded in-memory ring buffer. Each record includes HTTP method, path, status code, wall time, response Content-Type and Content-Length.
  - An N+1 detector flags any request that issued ≥ M structurally identical SQL statements (default `M = 5`, configurable via `[dev] inspector_n_plus_one_threshold`). The flag includes the offending SQL template and the repetition count.
  - A `RequestInspector` Axum extractor is available to handlers in `dev` profile to append SQL query records (with SQL text, bound parameters, elapsed time, and `file:line` call site). Integration tests can use the extractor to assert "this request issued exactly K queries."
  - The inspector UI (server-rendered HTML, no client-side framework) lists requests newest-first with method, path, status, duration, query count, and an N+1 warning badge. Clicking a request opens a detail view with a per-query timing table and a `curl` snippet to reproduce the request.
  - The inspector excludes its own requests from the ring buffer to avoid feedback loops.
  - New `[dev]` config section: `inspector_path`, `inspector_capacity`, `inspector_n_plus_one_threshold`.
  - Existing apps require zero changes — the inspector is purely additive.
  - See `docs/guide/dev-inspector.md` for the full guide.

- **pagination:** Wire first-class pagination into `#[repository]` and scaffold (#681)
  - `#[repository]` now generates a `page(req: &PageRequest) -> AutumnResult<Page<Model>>` method on every repository struct, enabling offset pagination without hand-written SQL.  Results are ordered by `id DESC` for deterministic page boundaries.
  - `#[repository(Model, cursor_key = field)]` additionally generates `cursor_page(req: &CursorRequest) -> AutumnResult<CursorPage<Model>>` — keyset pagination sorted by `(field DESC, id DESC)`.  The cursor payload encodes both the sort-key value and `id` so the keyset filter is always correct: `WHERE (field < after_k) OR (field = after_k AND id < after_id)`.
  - `autumn generate scaffold` index actions use the `PageRequest` extractor directly.  Out-of-range values are clamped silently (consistent with the framework rule that list endpoints never 400 for bad paging params).
  - Scaffold-generated routes include a `pagination_nav` Maud helper with htmx-friendly Previous / Next links.
  - `examples/todo-app` updated: `Todo::page` added; HTML list view uses `PageRequest` and renders pagination controls.
  - `docs/guide/pagination.md` added, covering: offset vs cursor decision guide, macro entry points, overriding page size, declaring a cursor key, htmx wiring.

To opt out of the generated `page` method: implement your own list handler using `repo.find_all()` or a custom Diesel query.  The `find_all` method is unchanged.

- **security:** Centralize trusted-proxies policy across forwarded-header middleware (#812)
  - **New `[security.trusted_proxies]` config block** at the top level of `[security]`.
    Configure once; every framework middleware (rate limiter, method-override origin check,
    CSRF, HSTS detection, tracing fields) honours the same trust boundary automatically.
    Fields: `ranges` (CIDR list), `trusted_hops` (peel-N-from-right strategy), and
    `trust_forwarded_headers` (global on/off switch). Profile-aware defaults: `dev` trusts
    loopback only; `prod` defaults to no forwarding trust until configured.
  - **New extractors** in `autumn_web::extract`: `ClientAddr` (resolved client IP),
    `ClientHost` (resolved external hostname), `ClientScheme` (`"http"` / `"https"` after
    `X-Forwarded-Proto` evaluation). These are the only blessed way to read client identity
    from handlers and middleware — direct `X-Forwarded-*` reads are now rejected by the
    new CI `grep` guard.
  - **Deprecation:** `security.rate_limit.trusted_proxies` and
    `security.rate_limit.trust_forwarded_headers` continue to work for one minor release
    with a deprecation warning at startup pointing at the new top-level config.
    `autumn doctor --strict` fails when both old and new are set with conflicting values.
  - **Regression fixes:** Closes three related CVEs — PR #753 (`X-Forwarded-For`
    rate-limit bypass), PR #785 and PR #791 (`X-Forwarded-Host` CSRF/method-override
    spoofing bypass in `MethodOverrideLayer`). The PoC from PR #791 is now covered by
    a regression test that validates the override is rejected when the
    `ResolvedClientIdentity` host does not match the `Origin` header.
  - **Plugin author guide** added to `docs/guide/middleware.md` and
    `docs/guide/extensibility.md`: "Never read `X-Forwarded-*` directly. Use
    `ClientAddr` / `ClientHost` / `ClientScheme` extractors."
- **configuration:** Add TOML config file support to generated scaffolds and a runtime configuration system for live-tunable operational knobs (#773, #931).
- **data and repositories:** Add soft delete, high-performance bulk CRUD, Postgres full-text search, automatic version history, CSV import/export, and per-query statement timeout/slow-query telemetry support (#858, #881, #905, #922, #1075, #865).
- **development loop:** Add the dev-mode error overlay, generator conformance CI gate, dev-loop latency budgets, and framework runtime benchmarks (#1080, #1079, #920, #756).
- **HTTP and routing:** Add safe HTML method override handling, ETag conditional GET helpers, per-request timeout and body-size middleware, first-class response compression, and API versioning with deprecation and sunset lifecycles (#605, #853, #996, #1083, #1077).
- **operations:** Add rolling-deploy shutdown contracts, maintenance mode middleware and CLI commands, W3C trace-context propagation across jobs/mailers, traced outbound HTTP client retries/mocks, outbound signed webhooks with retries/DLQ/actuator endpoints, and pluggable error reporting for panics and 5xx responses (#843, #917, #854, #863, #923, #1047).
- **security:** Add encrypted credentials, at-rest attribute encryption, direct browser-to-storage uploads, trusted-host validation, CSP nonces, log parameter scrubbing, per-principal/API-token rate limits, TOTP auth scaffolding, and WebAuthn passkey scaffolding (#849, #1058, #860, #885, #915, #903, #1001, #1057, #1070).
- **state and collaboration:** Add after-commit callbacks, HTTP idempotency-key middleware, row-level multi-tenancy, Redis-backed global rate limiting, first-class feature flags, A/B experiments, distributed presence, active search/autocomplete widgets, inline field validation, and an injectable `Clock` extractor for deterministic tests (#778, #779, #876, #764, #1000, #1016, #973, #989, #991, #1014).
- **content and tooling:** Add Markdown rendering with frontmatter/SSG support, `autumn generate mailer`, migration safety preflight checks, and plugin hooks at framework-owned dependency boundaries (#921, #866, #762, #862).
- Expose recent structured logs via GET /actuator/logfile (#1168, #1184).
- **cli:** Add `--api` flag for JSON-only scaffold generation (#1153).
- Add transactional test isolation for database tests (#1055).
