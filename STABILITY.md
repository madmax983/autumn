# Autumn Stability Policy

This document is Autumn's commitment to its users: an explicit contract that
describes what is stable, what is not, and how we plan to evolve the
framework without destroying the applications that depend on it.

> **Status:** Autumn is pre-`1.0` (current release series: `0.x`). The
> guarantees below describe the policy that will become binding at the `1.0`
> release. The `0.x` releases follow the same policy *in spirit*, but Cargo
> treats every `0.x.y → 0.(x+1).0` bump as breaking, so we use those
> intermediate bumps to iterate toward the stable surface without pretending
> the contract is already final.

## Versioning (SemVer)

Starting with `1.0.0`, Autumn follows
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) applied to
the public API defined in this document.

Given a version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** (`1.0.0 → 2.0.0`) — we *may* make breaking changes to the public
  API. Every major release ships with a
  [migration guide](docs/migrations/) describing what changed and how to
  update.
- **MINOR** (`1.0.0 → 1.1.0`) — backwards-compatible feature additions. New
  modules, new methods, new configuration keys. Existing code that compiles
  against `1.0.0` will continue to compile against any `1.x.y`.
- **PATCH** (`1.0.0 → 1.0.1`) — backwards-compatible bug fixes, performance
  improvements, and documentation updates. No behavior changes other than
  fixing clearly incorrect behavior.

The concrete definition of "breaking" matches the Rust API guidelines and the
[Cargo SemVer compatibility reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html).

## The Public API Surface

**Stable (covered by SemVer):**

- All items reachable from `autumn_web` that are:
  - not marked `#[doc(hidden)]`,
  - not inside a module named `__private`, `internal`, or similar, and
  - not documented as "unstable", "experimental", or "subject to change".
- The procedural macros re-exported from `autumn-macros` (`#[get]`,
  `#[post]`, `#[put]`, `#[delete]`, `#[ws]`, `#[static_get]`,
  `#[autumn_web::main]`, `routes![]`, `static_routes![]`, `tasks![]`,
  `#[secured]`, `#[model]`, `#[repository]`, `#[service]`, `#[scheduled]`,
  `#[cached]`). Macro *input syntax* is part of the API contract; the
  generated code is not.
- The `AutumnConfig` TOML schema and all `AUTUMN_*` environment variables
  documented in [`autumn/src/config.rs`](autumn/src/config.rs).
- The HTTP surface mounted automatically by [`AppBuilder::run`][]:
  `/health`, `/live`, `/ready`, `/startup`, `/actuator/*`, `/static/**`.
  Their *paths* are stable. Response *shapes* for non-actuator endpoints
  are stable; actuator endpoint payloads follow the actuator docs.
- The CLI commands shipped by `autumn-cli` (`autumn new`, `autumn setup`,
  `autumn dev`, `autumn build`, `autumn migrate`) and their documented
  flags.

**Not stable (explicitly excluded from SemVer):**

- Anything marked `#[doc(hidden)]`. These are implementation details that
  macros or other internals need to reach, but user code must not depend on
  them.
- Anything under `autumn_web::reexports`. The crates re-exported there
  (`axum`, `diesel`, `diesel_async`, `http`, `tokio`, `tokio_util`,
  `tracing`, `validator`, `chrono`) follow *their own* versioning. See
  [Dependencies and re-exports](#dependencies-and-re-exports).
- Exact error messages (`Display` output, log lines, rendered HTML error
  pages). Only *types* and *status codes* are stable.
- Exact generated HTML/JSON byte sequences. We guarantee semantic
  equivalence (e.g. the error body stays a `{ "error": { "status": ..,
  "message": .. } }` shape), not byte-for-byte identity.
- Internals of derive expansions. The *input* syntax of `#[model]`,
  `#[repository]`, etc. is stable; the generated struct/impl names, field
  ordering, or intermediate helper items are not. Treat the macro output
  as opaque.
- Anything marked in its rustdoc as **experimental**, **unstable**, or
  **preview**. Feature flags whose name starts with `unstable-` are always
  excluded.
- Debug output (`Debug` impls). Useful for logs, not parsable.
- Private modules (`pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`) and the `tests` modules.

When in doubt: if `cargo doc --no-deps` doesn't list it, it is not part of
the public API.

## What counts as a breaking change

The following require a major version bump:

- Removing, renaming, or relocating a public item.
- Adding a required method to a public trait, or changing an existing
  signature. (Adding a *provided* method is allowed if it does not make an
  existing impl ambiguous.)
- Changing a function/method signature in a way that rejects previously
  accepted callers (adding a required parameter, tightening a bound,
  changing the return type).
- Adding, removing, or renaming a public struct field on a struct that is
  not `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Adding a variant to a public enum that is not `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Removing or renaming an enum variant, even on a `#[non_exhaustive]` enum.
- Removing a feature flag or changing what it enables in a non-additive
  way.
- Removing, renaming, or changing the meaning of an `AutumnConfig` key or
  `AUTUMN_*` environment variable.
- Changing the HTTP method or path of a built-in endpoint
  (e.g. moving `/health` to `/healthz` without aliasing).
- Bumping the MSRV outside the window described in the
  [MSRV policy](#minimum-supported-rust-version-msrv-policy).
- Bumping a major version of a re-exported dependency whose types appear in
  our public API (e.g. `axum::Router` leaking through
  `AppBuilder::router`). These bumps are called out in the migration guide
  of the corresponding major release.

## What does *not* count as a breaking change

- Adding a new public item (module, type, function, method, trait impl
  that does not create coherence conflicts).
- Adding a new variant to a `#[non_exhaustive]` enum.
- Adding a new field to a `#[non_exhaustive]` struct, or a struct whose
  construction is guarded by a constructor (e.g. a builder).
- Adding a new optional configuration key with a sensible default.
- Adding a new feature flag (opt-in).
- Performance improvements that do not change observable behavior.
- Bug fixes, even if they change the observable behavior of clearly
  incorrect previous output (e.g. returning a correct status code instead
  of an incorrect one). The CHANGELOG calls these out under **Fixed**.
- Internal refactors that leave the public API intact.
- Tightening `#[doc(hidden)]` items or removing them entirely.
- Changing log message wording or tracing span names.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) policy

- Autumn declares its MSRV in two places, which must agree:
  1. `rust-version` in [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml).
  2. The `rust-*` badge in [`README.md`](README.md) and the Requirements
     section.
- CI runs a dedicated `MSRV` job (see
  [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) that builds the
  workspace with the declared toolchain. A
  [`scripts/check-msrv.sh`](scripts/check-msrv.sh) check verifies that all
  `rust-version` declarations in the workspace match each other and match
  the MSRV in the CI matrix. If the numbers diverge, CI fails.
- **MSRV bumps are allowed in a MINOR release** once the new MSRV is at
  least 6 months old as a stable Rust release. This matches the policy of
  Tokio, Serde, and most of the Rust ecosystem: we get to use modern
  language features without each bump counting as a breaking change.
- MSRV bumps are always called out in the CHANGELOG under an **MSRV**
  heading for that release.
- A MAJOR release may set any MSRV; the new MSRV is documented in the
  migration guide.
- We never lower the MSRV in a patch release. We *may* raise it in a
  patch release only to fix a soundness or security issue that cannot be
  fixed otherwise; such bumps are vanishingly rare and documented
  explicitly.

## Dependencies and re-exports

Autumn is a framework, not a walled garden. We re-export core building
blocks (Axum, Diesel, Tokio, …) under `autumn_web::reexports` so that users
can opt into the full upstream API without adding a second dependency.

This means our stability is coupled to the upstream crates. Our policy:

- A major bump of a *leaf* dependency (something that does not appear in
  our public API) is a patch or minor release here, not a major bump.
- A major bump of a dependency whose types *do* appear in our public API
  (e.g. upgrading `axum` from `0.8` to `0.9`, or `diesel` from `2` to
  `3`) is a major release of Autumn. The migration guide documents the
  upstream changes users need to be aware of.
- We are explicit about which dependency versions a given Autumn release
  supports. See `[workspace.dependencies]` in
  [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml).
- We do not promise that every compatible upstream patch release will be
  picked up immediately. We do promise to respond to upstream security
  advisories within a reasonable window (ideally within one patch
  release).

## Feature flags

Cargo feature flags are part of the public API:

- Removing a feature flag, or changing what it enables, is a breaking
  change.
- Adding a new feature flag is *not* a breaking change, provided it is
  additive.
- Features named `unstable-*` are explicitly excluded from the stability
  policy. Use them at your own risk.
- The `default` feature set is stable: removing a feature from `default`
  is a breaking change.

## Deprecation process

We prefer a long deprecation ramp over abrupt removal:

1. An item is marked with `#[deprecated]` in a minor release and a
   replacement is documented.
2. The deprecation note stays for at least one full minor cycle, ideally
   longer.
3. The item is removed in the next *major* release.

Deprecations never change behavior — only signal intent.

## Migration guides

Every major release ships with a migration guide under
[`docs/migrations/`](docs/migrations/). The guide is written against the
[migration guide template](docs/migrations/TEMPLATE.md) and covers:

1. The summary and scope of the breaking changes.
2. MSRV delta, if any.
3. A section per breaking change with *before* / *after* code snippets.
4. Compiler-error cheat sheet — "if you see this error, do that".
5. Dependency major bumps carried with the release.
6. Link to the CHANGELOG section for the release.

Draft migration guides are opened alongside the first breaking change that
targets the next major; they are merged and polished across the prerelease
cycle so that the `x.0.0` release ships with a complete guide on day one.

## CSV import/export (issue #808)

### SemVer impact

The CSV import/export surface introduced by issue #808 is **gated behind the
`csv` Cargo feature** (`autumn-web = { features = ["csv"] }`) for the first
minor release cycle.  Enabling an opt-in feature is non-breaking per the
feature-flag policy above; callers who do not enable `csv` are unaffected.

Once the feature graduates out of its initial cycle the `csv` feature will
remain (removing it would be a breaking change), but its content may be
stabilised into the `default` feature set.

### New public items (all `#[cfg(feature = "csv")]`)

| Item | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `autumn_web::data::csv::CsvSchema` | trait | Stable input API; generated expansion is not |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::ImportReport` | struct | `#[non_exhaustive]` for forward compat |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::ImportMode` | enum | `#[non_exhaustive]` |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::ImportOptions` | struct | |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::CsvRowError` | struct | |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::ImportRowResult` | enum | |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::export_csv` | free fn | |
| `autumn_web::data::csv::import_csv` | free fn | |

### Admin plugin additions (`autumn-admin-plugin`)

Two new **provided methods** on `AdminModel` (non-breaking per the trait
evolution policy):

- `fn supports_csv_export(&self) -> bool` — defaults to `true`
- `fn csv_export_columns(&self) -> Vec<&'static str>` — defaults to non-hidden, non-password fields
- `fn csv_export_row(&self, columns: &[&str], record: &Value) -> Vec<String>`
- `fn supports_csv_import(&self) -> bool` — defaults to `false`
- `fn import_csv_row(…) -> AdminFuture<AdminImportRowResult>` — defaults to `Skipped`

Two new HTTP routes (non-breaking; additive):

- `GET /admin/{slug}/export.csv`
- `GET /admin/{slug}/import` (import form)
- `POST /admin/{slug}/import` (multipart upload)

### CLI additions (`autumn-cli`)

New `autumn data` subcommand (non-breaking; additive):

- `autumn data export <model> [--out <file>] [--where <expr>]`
- `autumn data import <model> --in <file> [--dry-run] [--upsert-by <col>]`

### PII redaction strategy

Override `csv_export_columns` to omit sensitive column names from the header
row, or override `csv_export_row` to return `"[REDACTED]"` for a column's
value while keeping the column in the header.  Fields declared with
`AdminFieldKind::Password` are **always excluded** from the default column
list; fields declared `AdminFieldKind::Hidden` are also excluded.

### Transactional batching strategy

`import_csv` processes rows one at a time via the caller-supplied `handler`
closure.  To batch within a database transaction, wrap the handler in a
transaction opened before the call and committed (or rolled back) after.
The `batch_size` knob in `ImportOptions` signals the intended chunk size to
the caller but does not enforce it — the framework does not hold a connection
open across the call.

### Custom column override

To add a computed column (e.g. a joined display value from a related table):

```rust
fn csv_export_columns(&self) -> Vec<&'static str> {
    vec!["id", "title", "author_name"]   // "author_name" is not a real DB column
}

fn csv_export_row(&self, columns: &[&str], record: &Value) -> Vec<String> {
    columns.iter().map(|col| match *col {
        "author_name" => lookup_author_display(record),
        _ => record.get(*col).map(|v| match v {
            Value::String(s) => s.clone(),
            other => other.to_string(),
        }).unwrap_or_default(),
    }).collect()
}
```

## Pre-1.0 notes

Until Autumn reaches `1.0.0`:

- Every minor (`0.x.0 → 0.(x+1).0`) release *may* contain breaking
  changes. Cargo's SemVer rules already treat these as breaking, and we
  use them to iterate on the public surface before it is frozen.
- We still keep a CHANGELOG with **Breaking Changes** callouts for every
  `0.x` bump so users know what to look out for.
- The guarantees above (MSRV handling, non-exhaustive markers, re-export
  policy, feature flags) are already honored. The only difference is that
  the API itself is allowed to move.
- Reaching `1.0.0` is a decision, not a calendar event: we will declare
  1.0 when the surface described above has been stable across a couple of
  `0.x` cycles without user-facing churn.
