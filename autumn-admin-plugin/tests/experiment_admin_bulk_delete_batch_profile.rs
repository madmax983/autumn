//! Ledger findings/fix harness for `ExperimentAdminModel::execute_action`'s
//! bulk `"delete"` action (`autumn-admin-plugin/src/experiments.rs`), the
//! default [`AdminModel::execute_action`] trait method (`traits.rs`) drives
//! when a model doesn't override it.
//!
//! Drives the REAL production path: `POST /admin/{slug}/actions`
//! (`autumn-admin-plugin/src/routes.rs`, `model_action`) parses an
//! uncapped, repeated `ids=` form field and calls
//! `model.execute_action(&pool, "delete", ids)` directly — this harness
//! calls `ExperimentAdminModel::execute_action` the same way, skipping only
//! the HTTP form-decoding step, against a production-shaped
//! `autumn_experiments` table plus its two cascading child tables
//! (`autumn_experiment_assignments`, `autumn_experiment_overrides`).
//!
//! Before the fix in this same PR, the trait's default `execute_action`
//! looped over `ids` and called `self.delete(&pool, id)` once per id — a
//! full `pool.get()` + single-row CTE round trip (delete the experiment,
//! cascade-delete its sticky assignments and staff overrides, write one
//! audit row) per id, with no batching at all (traits.rs) — hundreds of
//! statements for what is, on the wire, one predicate, exactly the shape
//! already closed for `TokenAdminModel`
//! (`docs/reports/2026-08-31-ledger-admin-bulk-delete-batch/`) and
//! `FeatureFlagAdminModel`
//! (`docs/reports/2026-09-06-ledger-feature-flag-admin-bulk-delete-batch/`);
//! `ExperimentAdminModel` never got the same override.
//!
//! `model_action` itself caps `ids` at nothing -- that's a route-level
//! property. The *stock* admin list template only renders a checkbox for
//! the current page's rows, and `ExperimentAdminModel` doesn't override
//! `per_page()`'s 25-row default, so today's shipped UI tops a single
//! click out at 25 ids, not the 615 this harness submits. See the
//! "Reachability, precisely stated" note in
//! `docs/reports/2026-09-07-ledger-experiment-admin-bulk-delete-batch/README.md`
//! (added after review) for why the 615-id shape is still the right thing
//! to benchmark: the endpoint has no cap to bypass, and the same per-id
//! loop this fix replaces runs once per `POST /admin/experiments/actions`
//! regardless of how many ids that request carries, so 25 requests of 25
//! ids pay the identical N+1 tax as one request of 615.
//!
//! **Requires Docker.** Run manually with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p autumn-admin-plugin --test experiment_admin_bulk_delete_batch_profile \
//!   -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! This crate has no consolidated `tests/integration/mod.rs` (unlike
//! `autumn`/`autumn-cli`, see CLAUDE.md) and CI does not run a bare
//! `--ignored` sweep over this package either — this binary needs, and has,
//! an explicit `--test experiment_admin_bulk_delete_batch_profile` line in
//! `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s "Run Docker-dependent tests" step (and again
//! in the coverage step), right next to the existing `token_admin_*` /
//! `feature_flag_admin_*` lines — a bare sweep would silently never compile
//! or run it.
//!
//! ## Fixture
//!
//! A 3,000-row `autumn_experiments` table (the real schema from
//! `autumn/migrations/20260530300000_create_experiments/up.sql`, included
//! verbatim via `include_str!` so the fixture can't drift from what the
//! admin UI actually manages) — a plausible size for a long-lived app that
//! never prunes concluded/archived experiments. 35% NULL `description`,
//! state skewed toward `concluded` (50%) and `archived` (25%) over
//! `running` (15%) and `draft` (10%) — the long-tail shape of an app that
//! ships new experiments continuously but rarely deletes old ones — with
//! `winner` set on roughly 70% of concluded rows (measured and printed by
//! the harness, not assumed: `gs % 7 < 5` selects within `concluded` using
//! a modulus coprime to the 20-wide state-assignment cycle, so the two
//! conditions land independently rather than the two `CASE` predicates
//! silently correlating through a shared divisor) and NULL elsewhere, and
//! `exclusion_group` NULL for 60% of rows, else one of 15 group names
//! (cardinality skew).
//!
//! Each experiment gets a variable number of sticky assignments
//! (`autumn_experiment_assignments`, 10–170 rows per experiment depending on
//! how wide its rollout was, ~270k rows total) and 0–3 staff overrides
//! (`autumn_experiment_overrides`, ~4.5k rows total) — real cardinality
//! skew, not a uniform fixture. `autumn_experiment_changes` (the audit log
//! the real `delete()` CTE writes to) is pre-seeded with 3 rows per
//! experiment (9,000 rows) — "created" / "state=running" / "concluded" — so
//! the audit table is a realistic size, not empty, when the bulk action
//! adds to it. Real dead tuples come from a follow-up `UPDATE` before
//! `ANALYZE`.
//!
//! The bulk-delete selection is 600 ids — a plausible one-shift "prune
//! every experiment this quarter's cleanup marked dead" operator action —
//! scattered every 5th id across the table (not a contiguous head block),
//! of which 45 are force-deleted *before* the action runs (a previous,
//! narrower cleanup already caught them — must stay a no-op, not error),
//! plus 15 ids past `TOTAL_ROWS` that never existed at all (same
//! requirement). The exact pre-existing count is measured with a
//! `COUNT(*)`, not assumed, per the Ledger process and the review-caught
//! lesson the `TokenAdminModel`/`FeatureFlagAdminModel` harnesses this one
//! mirrors already learned.
