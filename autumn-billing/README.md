# autumn-billing

Subscription billing for [autumn-web](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn)
applications. Stripe is the first provider.

The plugin gives you:

- Hosted checkout and the customer portal (`POST /billing/checkout`, `POST /billing/portal`).
- A local **mirror** of customers, subscriptions and invoices, fed by signed webhooks.
- A **plan gate**: the `Entitled<R>` extractor and the `Billing` handle read the mirror only.
- **Dunning**: durable payment retries on a schedule you set, with in-app notifications.

The provider stays the source of truth. The mirror is what your handlers read.

## Installation

```sh
autumn plugin add autumn-billing
```

Or add the dependency by hand:

```toml
[dependencies]
autumn-billing = "0.8.0"
```

## Mount

```rust
use autumn_billing::prelude::*;

let billing = BillingConfig::from_autumn_toml("autumn.toml")?;
let plans = PlanCatalog::new().plan(
    Plan::new("pro", "Pro", "price_123", Money::from_minor(1999, Currency::USD), BillingInterval::Month)
        .entitlement("export"),
);

autumn_web::app()
    .plugin(BillingPlugin::new().config(billing).plans(&plans))
    .run()
    .await;
```

`BillingPlugin` also accepts `.provider(..)`, `.store(..)` and `.hooks(..)`.
The default store is the database when a pool exists, else memory (lost on
restart). In production the memory store is a boot error unless
`billing.allow_memory_store_in_production = true`.

The bare `.plugin(autumn_billing::BillingPlugin::new())` boots with config
from the environment only and an empty plan catalog. Registering the plugin
twice is a no-op: the framework installs each plugin once.

## Webhook endpoint

Declare the receiver in `autumn.toml`. `SignedWebhook` verifies the
signature and CSRF exempts the path. Boot fails when the entry is missing,
when its `provider` preset is not the one the billing provider needs, or when
it allows less than 4 MiB of request body.

```toml
[[security.webhooks.endpoints]]
name = "billing"
path = "/billing/webhook"
provider = "stripe"
secret_env = "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
max_body_bytes = 4194304
```

`max_body_bytes` is not optional here: the webhook default is 1 MiB, and a
provider event that carries many invoice lines can be larger. An oversized body
is rejected before it is reconciled and the provider retries it unchanged, so
the event is never applied. A larger limit is yours to choose.

## Configuration

Every `[billing]` key with its default. Omit a key to keep the default.

```toml
[billing]
route_prefix = "/billing"        # mount point of the routes
endpoint_name = "billing"        # name of the [[security.webhooks.endpoints]] entry
success_url = "/billing/success" # redirect after a completed checkout
cancel_url = "/billing/cancel"   # redirect after an abandoned checkout
portal_return_url = "/"          # redirect when the customer leaves the portal
allow_past_due = false           # entitle `past_due` subscriptions
grace_period_hours = 72          # entitlement past `current_period_end`
allow_memory_store_in_production = false # boot without a database pool in production

[billing.dunning]
enabled = true                       # `false`: mirror and notify, never retry
retry_delays_hours = [24, 72, 120]   # delay before retry 1, 2 and 3
on_exhausted = "cancel_subscription" # or "mark_unpaid"

[billing.stripe]
secret_key = "sk_test_..."           # STRIPE_SECRET_KEY wins
webhook_secret = "whsec_..."         # STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET wins
api_base = "https://api.stripe.com"  # AUTUMN_BILLING__STRIPE__API_BASE wins; https:// in production

[[billing.plans]]                    # none by default; merged with the code catalog
id = "pro"
name = "Pro"
price_id = "price_pro"
amount_minor = 1999
currency = "USD"
interval = "month"                   # "day", "week", "month" or "year"
entitlements = ["export"]
```

Load the section with `BillingConfig::from_autumn_toml("autumn.toml")`, or
build it in code: `BillingConfig::from_env().urls(..).dunning(..)`.

## Environment

Environment values win over `autumn.toml` values. Blank values are ignored.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | API key (`sk_live_…` / `sk_test_…`). Production rejects test keys. Overrides `billing.stripe.secret_key`. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signing secret (`whsec_…`). Overrides `billing.stripe.webhook_secret`. |
| `AUTUMN_BILLING__STRIPE__API_BASE` | Stripe API base URL. Overrides `billing.stripe.api_base`. Production requires `https://`. |
| `AUTUMN_BILLING__ROUTE_PREFIX` | Mount point of the routes. Overrides `billing.route_prefix`. |

## Plans

In code:

```rust
let plans = PlanCatalog::new()
    .plan(Plan::new("pro", "Pro", "price_pro", Money::from_minor(1999, Currency::USD), BillingInterval::Month)
        .entitlement("export"))
    .plan(Plan::new("team", "Team", "price_team", Money::from_minor(4999, Currency::USD), BillingInterval::Month)
        .entitlement("export")
        .entitlement("sso"));
```

Or as `[[billing.plans]]` entries in `autumn.toml` (see Configuration).
Both sources merge into one catalog.

## Gate a route

```rust
struct Pro;
impl PlanRequirement for Pro {
    fn rule() -> PlanRule { PlanRule::plan("pro") }
}

#[get("/reports")]
async fn reports(_pro: Entitled<Pro>) -> &'static str { "ok" }
```

`Entitled<R>` runs before the body is read. It answers `401` without a
session user and `403` without an entitled subscription.

For a decision inside a handler, `Billing::current_user` reads the user id
with the app's configured auth session key:

```rust
#[get("/export")]
async fn export(billing: Billing, session: Session) -> AutumnResult<&'static str> {
    let user_id = billing
        .current_user(&session)
        .await
        .map_err(BillingError::into_autumn)?;
    let view = billing
        .require(&user_id, &PlanRule::entitlement("export"))
        .await
        .map_err(BillingError::into_autumn)?;
    Ok("ok")
}
```

A user is entitled when the mirror subscription is `active` or `trialing`
(`past_due` only with `allow_past_due = true`), the price maps to a catalog
plan, and `current_period_end` plus `grace_period` (default 72h) is not in
the past. Without a known period end the grace period counts from the last
event applied to the row. Every missing piece denies.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Auth | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/billing/checkout` | session | `303` to checkout, or JSON `{ "url", "id" }` with `Accept: application/json`. `404` unknown plan, `409` live subscription exists. |
| POST | `/billing/portal` | session | `303` to the portal, or JSON `{ "url", "id" }`. `404` when the user has no customer. |
| GET | `/billing/subscription` | session | JSON `{subscription, plan, entitled}` from the mirror. |
| POST | `/billing/webhook` | Stripe signature | JSON `{accepted, outcome, event_id}`. |

`checkout` takes `{"plan": "pro"}` as JSON or `plan=pro` as a form. Redirect
URLs come from the config only.

## Dunning

When an invoice payment fails the plugin opens a `billing_dunning` row and
schedules the retry job. The default policy runs three retries. The first
retry runs 1 day after the failure, the second 3 days after that, the third
5 days after that (days 1, 4 and 9). After the last failed retry the plugin
cancels the subscription. Every retry goes through the store row, so a
duplicate or early job run is a no-op.

```rust
let billing = BillingConfig::from_env()
    .dunning(DunningPolicy::standard().with_on_exhausted(ExhaustionAction::MarkUnpaid));
```

After a restart the plugin re-arms every pending row from the store. No
retry is lost. A retry whose provider call fails in transport keeps its
attempt number and runs again 15 minutes later; a row left `running` by a
crashed process is reclaimed after 10 minutes.

**Stripe Smart Retries**: disable them in the Stripe dashboard when the
plugin retries, or the two schedules compete. To keep Stripe's retries, use
`DunningPolicy::disabled()`: the plugin mirrors and notifies but never retries.

## Notifications

Each step writes to the in-app notification store (`Notifications`). The
recipient is `BillingHooks::recipient_for(user_id)` for the customer's
linked user. `None` suppresses the notification.

| Kind | Payload fields |
| --- | --- |
| `billing.payment_failed` | `invoice_id`, `provider_invoice_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount_due`, `attempt` (scheduled retry number; `null` when dunning is disabled), `provider_attempt_count`, `reason` |
| `billing.payment_recovered` | `invoice_id`, `provider_invoice_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount_paid` |
| `billing.dunning_exhausted` | `invoice_id`, `provider_invoice_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount_due`, `attempts`, `action` |
| `billing.subscription_canceled` | `subscription_id`, `provider_subscription_id`, `plan_id` |

Money fields serialize as `{"minor": 1999, "currency": "USD"}`.

## Database

Five tables: `billing_customers`, `billing_subscriptions`,
`billing_invoices`, `billing_events` (the idempotency ledger) and
`billing_dunning`. The migration is `20260910203829_billing_mirror`, registered
by the plugin. A partial unique index on `billing_customers.user_id` keeps
one customer per user when two checkouts race. Applied ledger rows older than
30 days are pruned at startup. Without a pool the plugin uses the in-memory
store; production refuses it unless `allow_memory_store_in_production` is set.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test -p autumn-billing
```

Postgres contract tests need Docker:

```sh
cargo test -p autumn-billing --test mirror_db -- --ignored
```
