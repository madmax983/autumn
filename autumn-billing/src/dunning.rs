//! Durable retries for failed payments.
//!
//! The `billing_dunning` row is the schedule. The job payload carries only the
//! local invoice id; the job reads the row, so a duplicate or early run is a
//! no-op and a restart re-arms from the store. Every write after the claim is
//! a compare-and-set on the row's state and attempt, so a reconcile that
//! settles the row while a retry is in flight wins.
