//! `autumn agents manifest` — emit the agent-authority manifest (issue #1691).
//!
//! Runs the app's own binary in agent-authority dump mode
//! (`AUTUMN_DUMP_AGENT_AUTHORITY=1`), reads back the manifest the framework
//! assembles from every `#[agent_operable]` action and every declared
//! `authority_grant!` it links, joins it against the app's route table, and
//! writes it out as a build artifact.
//!
//! Why run the binary rather than parse the sources: which handlers are
//! agent-operable — and which of them an agent can actually *reach* — is a
//! whole-app fact. An action declared in a plugin the app merely depends on is
//! still an action an agent can take, and link-time `inventory` collection is
//! the only place all of those registrations exist together. Same shape as
//! `autumn data-flow` (#1654), `autumn cache audit` (#1716) and
//! `autumn routes audit` (#1604).
//!
//! Unlike `data-flow`, this command *does* have gates of its own — and
//! `--check` is where they live, which makes it the CI invocation. The compiler
//! is still the gate for everything a grant covers — an unlisted write does not
//! build — but three things are invisible to it by construction, so `--check`
//! fails on:
//!
//! * an MCP-exposed **mutating** tool with no envelope (unless
//!   `--allow-ungoverned`), because a tool with no grant has no const assertion
//!   to fail;
//! * a binary with **no audit sink** that can still take an action nothing can
//!   undo (unless `--allow-unaudited`) — with no sink installed the audit write
//!   trivially succeeds, so the runtime's fail-closed refusal never fires and
//!   the invocation leaves no trace at all;
//! * a route naming an **authority nothing registered**, which would otherwise
//!   appear in no list and so in no gate;
//! * and drift from the committed manifest.
//!
