//! `autumn calibrate` — the impure half: build, boot, drive load, sample
//! (issue #1733).
//!
//! This module is the orchestration side of the capacity contract. It builds
//! the target binary in **release** mode (a debug-profile envelope is not a
//! number anyone should size infrastructure from), reads its route graph back
//! through the same `AUTUMN_DUMP_ROUTES` pipeline `autumn routes` uses, boots
//! it on a reserved port with admission control *off*, walks a seeded
//! concurrency ladder against it, and hands the samples to the pure,
//! unit-tested logic in [`crate::capacity`].
//!
//! All of it is subprocess / TCP / wall-clock I/O that cannot be exercised in
//! unit tests, so this file is excluded from coverage (see `codecov.yml`),
//! mirroring `cold_start_driver.rs`, `scaling_driver.rs`, and
//! `overload_driver.rs`.
//!
//! ## Why admission control is disabled during calibration
//!
//! Calibration measures what the binary *can* sustain. Leaving a previously
//! configured `server.max_concurrent_requests` — or an already-committed
//! contract — in force would measure that ceiling instead, and each
//! re-calibration would ratchet the recorded envelope down toward whatever
//! the last one happened to record. The driver clears both in the child's
//! environment so every run measures the app, not its own last answer.
