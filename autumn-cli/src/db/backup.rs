//! `autumn db backup` / `autumn db restore` — logical dump/restore for
//! self-hosted, daemon, and single-binary Autumn deployments (issue #1595).
//!
//! These commands shell out to `pg_dump` / `pg_restore`, resolving the database
//! URL(s) through the **exact same** code path as `autumn migrate` / the other
//! `autumn db` commands ([`crate::migrate::resolve_primary_url`],
//! [`crate::migrate::resolve_shard_database_urls_from_sources`]) so a backup
//! captures precisely the databases the running app uses — control plus every
//! configured shard — under the active profile/env overlay. The destructive
//! `restore` is gated by the same production guard as `autumn db drop`
//! (`guard_destructive`).
//!
//! # Artifact layout (S3-bolt-on friendly — issue #1619)
//!
//! A single `backup` run writes one self-describing *run directory*:
//!
//! ```text
//! <dir>/<profile>/<timestamp>/
//!     manifest.json          # version, created_at, profile, format, targets[]
//!     control.dump           # pg_dump -Fc (default; compressed) — or control.sql (plain)
//!     shard-<name>.dump      # one per configured shard
//! ```
//!
//! The run directory is the atomic unit of both retention (`--keep N`) and any
//! future offsite upload (#1619 can enumerate `manifest.json` and push the whole
//! prefix). Nothing outside this directory is touched.
//!
//! # Zero-external-tools for managed Postgres (AC #2)
//!
//! [`PgTools::locate`](crate::db::backup::PgTools::locate) resolves
//! `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` from, in order: an
//! explicit `AUTUMN_PG_BIN_DIR`, the managed-Postgres bundle's `bin` directory
//! (derived from `AUTUMN_MANAGED_PG_DATA_DIR`, which `autumn serve --bundled-pg`
//! sets), then the `PATH`. A managed-pg daemon therefore needs no externally
//! installed client tools.
