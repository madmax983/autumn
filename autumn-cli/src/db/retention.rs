//! `autumn db retention` — report, dry-run, and on-demand purge of the
//! unified data-retention policy for framework-owned data (issue #1605).
//!
//! Every number this command prints comes from the application binary, not
//! from the CLI: it compiles and runs the app with
//! `AUTUMN_DB_RETENTION=report|purge` and reads the JSON report from the one
//! line of stdout starting with `AUTUMN_DB_RETENTION_REPORT=`. That is deliberate
//! rather than convenient — the policy depends on the app's own resolved
//! config, its GDPR legal-hold registrations, and its installed audit sinks,
//! none of which the standalone CLI can see. Running it in-app means the
//! report and the enforcement come from one code path and cannot drift.
//!
//! Mirrors the `autumn retention --dry-run` (issue #1342) plumbing, which
//! does the same thing for app-declared `#[repository(..., retention(...))]`
//! policies.
