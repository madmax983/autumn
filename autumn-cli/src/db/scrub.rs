//! `autumn db scrub` — turn a production database (or an `autumn db backup`
//! artifact) into an anonymized copy that is safe on a laptop or a shared
//! staging box (issue #1602).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The moment logical backups ship (#1595), a production copy is one command
//! away from a non-production machine — PII and all. Every peer tool for this
//! job (Greenmask, pgsync + obfuscation config, the PostgreSQL Anonymizer
//! extension, django-scrubber) is **schema-blind**: the developer hand-maintains
//! a column list that silently rots the first time someone adds an `email`
//! column, which is exactly the failure mode that leaks PII.
//!
//! Autumn is not schema-blind. This command classifies columns from three
//! sources, in precedence order:
//!
//! 1. **`[tables.<t>.pii]` in `scrub.toml`** — the developer's explicit
//!    declaration, including the replacement strategy.
//! 2. **`#[encrypted]` model columns** — machine-readable PII semantics the
//!    framework already holds ([`crate::schema::parse::parse_encrypted_columns`]).
//!    A `safe` declaration may **not** override these.
//! 3. **GDPR `ModelRegistration::anonymize("<table>")` registrations** — a
//!    table-level signal, so every non-key column of that table is classified
//!    PII unless explicitly declared `safe`.
//!
//! Everything left over is **unclassified**, and an unclassified column is a
//! hard failure (`ScrubError::Unclassified`) — never a silent pass-through.
//! Because the column universe comes from **introspecting the live database**
//! (not from the config file), a column added yesterday cannot be missing from
//! that universe: adding a column without declaring it breaks the scrub, which
//! is the whole point.
//!
//! # Safety properties
//!
//! - **Fail-closed.** Unclassified, stale (naming a column that no longer
//!   exists), and self-contradictory declarations all refuse before a single row
//!   is touched. The one exception is `--artifact`: the restore must run before
//!   the classification can read the schema it creates, so a refusal after a
//!   restore leaves unscrubbed data in the target — and says so, loudly.
//! - **Production guard.** Writing refuses outside `dev`/`test` without
//!   `--force`, the identical protocol as `autumn db drop`
//!   ([`crate::db::guard_destructive`]).
//! - **Constraint-preserving.** PII on a primary- or foreign-key column is
//!   refused outright (so referential integrity is untouched), `NULL` is refused
//!   on a `NOT NULL` column, a constant replacement is refused on a `UNIQUE`
//!   column, and a `varchar(n)` bound narrows the generated value or refuses.
//! - **Atomic.** Every target is classified before any target is written (so an
//!   undeclared column on one shard cannot leave the topology half anonymized),
//!   and every statement for one database runs in a single transaction: a
//!   half-scrubbed database is never left behind.
//! - **Framework-aware.** Introspection excludes `autumn_*` tables from the
//!   classified universe, so the ones that carry app-supplied payloads (queued
//!   jobs, offline-sync rows, `api_tokens`) are reported separately and emptied
//!   when the app opts in with `[framework] purge`.
//! - **Credential-safe.** No error or report ever embeds a resolved URL.

/// z_source` yielded no edge when only the outer function's own relation
/// dependencies were read, and `a_report` refreshed first from a stale
/// `z_source` while keeping all 200 original addresses. `reach` walks that from each
/// materialized view through anything that is not one, and `edge` keeps the
/// pairs that land on one. A function whose body is a string literal records no
/// such dependency at all and cannot be walked; `untraceable_view_functions`
/// refuses those rather than ordering around a gap. `reach` recurses with `UNION` over a
/// finite set of pairs, so it terminates whatever the view graph looks like.
///
/// `fn_seed` is keyed by the RULE, not by the object the rule references,
/// because a rule can name a function by more than one catalog path and the
/// earlier shape could only follow one of them. Measured on `PostgreSQL`
/// 16.13, over the four indirections a rule can record:
///
/// | how the view reaches the function | the rule's `pg_depend` row |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | calls it directly                | `pg_proc` |
/// | through a cast                   | `pg_proc` (the cast function) |
/// | through an aggregate             | `pg_proc` (then `pg_proc -> pg_proc` to the sfunc) |
/// | through a user-defined operator  | `pg_operator` — and NO `pg_proc` row |
/// | through a domain's CHECK         | `pg_type` — and NO `pg_proc` row |
///
/// The first three were already followed; the last two were not, and the
/// operator case is a silent leak rather than a missed refinement. Measured:
/// `a_report` reading `z_source` only through `1 ==> 200`, whose implementation
/// is a tracked `BEGIN ATOMIC` function, produced no edge at all, so the two
/// views sorted by name, `a_report` refreshed FIRST from a stale `z_source`,
/// and the run reported `Scrub complete` with `users` at 2 rows, `z_source`
/// clean, and all 200 original addresses still in `a_report`. The domain case
/// is the same blind spot and fails closed instead — the check fires against
/// the stale view during the rewrite and aborts the transaction — but it is the
/// same missing edge, so it is seeded the same way rather than left to luck.
///
/// `oprcode` and `pg_constraint.contypid` are both older than every server this
/// command supports, so neither needs a `has_catalog_column` probe.
///
/// `needed` is every POPULATED view, plus every view one of those reads, however
/// deep. Both halves matter:
///
/// - A view created — or last refreshed — `WITH NO DATA` holds no rows at all.
///   Measured on `PostgreSQL` 16.13: `REFRESH ... WITH NO DATA` truncates the
///   heap (24 kB to 8 kB on a 200-row view) and selecting from one afterwards
///   raises `materialized view "…" has not been populated`. So it has no
///   pre-scrub copy to rebuild, and refreshing it would run the view's query and
///   materialize a heap the database deliberately does not have — on the
///   expensive query such a view usually guards, time and disk spent inside the
///   scrub's transaction, where exhausting either rolls the whole run back.
/// - An unpopulated view a populated one reads is a different case: `REFRESH`
///   on the dependent fails outright while its source is unpopulated (measured:
///   `materialized view "mv_a" has not been populated`), and an unrefreshed
///   populated view keeps its pre-scrub rows. So the source is refreshed after
///   all — and `unpopulated_views` puts it back after, which is safe because
///   emptying a source does not un-populate the dependent already rebuilt from
///   it (measured: the dependent kept `relispopulated` and all 200 rows).
///
/// `needed` recurses with `UNION`, not `UNION ALL`, so it terminates on its own
/// and needs no depth cap. The ordered walk built on top of it still has one,
