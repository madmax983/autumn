//! `autumn deploy` — push-button, zero-downtime deploys to a VPS (issue #1607).
//!
//! This slice implements the locally-verifiable spine of the command:
//!
//! - **`check`** runs a preflight (SSH reachability, signing secret, database
//!   URL, and a `migrate check`) and reports pass/fail, exiting non-zero if any
//!   grader fails.
//! - **`plan`** renders the systemd service unit and the ordered zero-downtime
//!   rollout plan as a pure dry-run — it touches nothing remote.
//! - **`up`** performs a REAL deploy: it runs the same preflight as `check`
//!   (aborting before touching the server if anything fails), then drives the
//!   ordered host-prep + first-deploy or zero-downtime cutover sequence against
//!   an injectable executor (the real one shells out to system `ssh`/`scp`), with
//!   auto-rollback of the candidate on a pre-cutover failure. See [`exec`].
//! - **`rollback`** performs a REAL on-demand rollback (Slice 3, AC-4): it
//!   resolves the previous release on the target, flips the proxy back to it,
//!   repoints `current`, and re-probes `/ready` — failing loudly when there is no
//!   previous release to roll back to.
//!
//! Only the CI end-to-end harness that exercises rollback over real ssh against a
//! container remains (Slice 4). The plan/unit generators here are pure functions
//! so they can be unit-tested without a server, and the preflight graders are
//! shared with `autumn doctor`.
