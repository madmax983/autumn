//! Injectable remote-execution layer for `autumn deploy` (issue #1607, Slices 1–3).
//!
//! This module turns the dry-run deploy plan into REAL execution behind an
//! injectable [`DeployExecutor`], so the command-construction and execution paths
//! are unit-testable without a live host.
//!
//! ## What is real here
//!
//! - **First deploy (Slice 1, proxy-fronted in Slice 2):** [`first_deploy_ops`]
//!   installs the reverse proxy on the public port, stands the initial release up
//!   on a PRIVATE loopback slot port, and routes the proxy at it — so a later
//!   redeploy has a live upstream to flip away from.
//! - **Zero-downtime redeploy (Slice 2, AC-2/AC-3):** [`cutover_ops`] is the pure,
//!   ordered cutover sequence: upload → write the candidate's env (0600) + unit on
//!   a SEPARATE loopback port → start the candidate (old release keeps serving) →
//!   run pending migrations BEFORE cutover → bounded `/ready` gate on the
//!   candidate → health-gated proxy flip old→candidate → promote `current` → drain
//!   the old release → prune. Because [`run_ops`] stops at the first failure, a
//!   failed migration or a readiness timeout aborts BEFORE the flip with the old
//!   release still serving (AC-3 / AC-2 safety).
//! - **Blue/green slots:** the candidate always takes the slot the live release is
//!   NOT using (see [`SlotPlan`]), so the candidate never binds the live port and
//!   the two releases run side by side across the cutover.
//! - **Execution:** [`run_ops`] / [`execute_first_deploy`] / [`execute_redeploy`]
//!   iterate the ops and drive a [`DeployExecutor`]; the `execute_*` entrypoints
//!   refuse to run if any preflight check failed (AC-6 fail-fast). [`DeployMode`]
//!   / [`probe_deploy_state`] pick first-vs-redeploy from a remote probe.
//! - **Rollback (Slice 3, AC-4):** two forms are real. On a failed redeploy gate
//!   (migrate or readiness — anything at or before the health-gated flip) traffic
//!   never moved, so [`execute_redeploy`] AUTO-rolls-back: it drives
//!   [`candidate_teardown_ops`] (stop + disable the candidate slot unit, remove
//!   its release dir), leaves the proxy on the still-serving old release, and
//!   fails with [`DeployExecError::CandidateRolledBack`]. On demand,
//!   [`resolve_rollback_target`] finds the previous release and [`rollback_ops`] /
//!   [`execute_rollback`] bring its slot back up, flip the proxy to it, repoint
//!   `current`, and re-probe `/ready`; with no previous release the resolve fails
//!   with [`DeployExecError::NoPreviousRelease`] and nothing destructive runs. A
//!   FIRST deploy has no previous release, so a pre-go-live failure tears the
//!   candidate down and fails with [`DeployExecError::FirstDeployTornDown`].
//! - **Proxy:** the kamal-proxy CLI lives entirely in
//!   [`KamalProxyController`](super::proxy::KamalProxyController); the cutover
//!   orchestration here talks only to the [`ProxyController`] trait, so a Caddy
//!   controller could replace it without touching this file.
//! - **Real ssh/scp:** [`SshExecutor`] shells out to the system `ssh`/`scp`
//!   binaries via [`std::process::Command`] (no ssh crate is pulled in). The argv
//!   builders [`ssh_argv`]/[`scp_argv`] are pure functions.
//! - **Secret redaction:** the env-file contents travel as a [`Secret`] whose
//!   `Debug`/`Display` are redacted, and secrets are only ever written to a
//!   `0600` file — never placed on a command line or into an error message. The
//!   migrate one-shot sources secrets via a systemd `EnvironmentFile`, not argv.
//!
//! ## What is deferred (NOT implemented in this slice)
//!
//! - The **CI end-to-end container harness** that exercises the real `ssh` path
//!   against a live container — actually driving a rollback over ssh end-to-end —
//!   is Slice 4; live ssh is not exercised by these unit tests.
//! - A **Caddy** [`ProxyController`] — kamal-proxy
//!   is the confirmed proxy; Caddy is only the documented swappable alternative.
//!
//! The migrate step is fully real: the one-shot runs the uploaded release with
//! `AUTUMN_MIGRATE=1`, which the app runtime honors (alongside its other
//! env-gated one-shot modes such as `AUTUMN_BUILD_STATIC=1`) by applying pending
//! embedded migrations with the same locked applier a normal boot uses and
//! exiting 0/non-zero WITHOUT starting the server — so a failed migration aborts
//! before cutover (AC-3).

/// so a legacy `current/<db>` pointing at a different database was linked past in
/// silence and the app served the shared one after cutover (#2589 item 8).

/// **2. Should the shared file be there?** A missing shared file is either a
/// first deploy or a mounted volume that is gone, and `current` cannot tell them
/// apart — on both, the link exists and dangles. The distinguishing signal is
/// [`ResolvedDeployConfig::sqlite_data_marker_file`], written once the database

/// | shared file | marker | |
/// | --- | --- | --- |
/// | present | either | proceed, and record the marker |
/// | absent | absent | proceed — never created, a genuine first deploy |
/// | absent | present | refuse: it existed once and is gone |
///
/// Without that distinction the deploy recreated the directory under the absent
/// mount, the migration opened the dangling link under `SQLite`'s
/// create-on-missing mode, and a fresh empty database was served while the real
/// one was orphaned (#2589 item 17).
///
/// # Then
///
/// **Set aside a stale real file.** A rollback target from before the migration
