//! Fleet planning for `autumn deploy` (issue #1621) — the PURE layer.
//!
//! A fleet rollout is a **thin, pure orchestration shell above unchanged per-host
//! op builders**. Nothing below [`exec::SshTarget`] moves: this module decides
//! *which* host does *what*, and then delegates to [`exec::first_deploy_ops`] /
//! [`exec::cutover_ops`] verbatim. Everything here is a pure function of its
//! inputs — no I/O, no clock, no host contact — so the "no mixed versions"
//! reasoning is unit-testable against synthetic probe modes with no server.
//!
//! Three rules are load-bearing and easy to break by accident:
//!
//! 1. **Each host's ops stay in their OWN `Vec`.** No code path may concatenate
//!    two hosts' [`exec::DeployOp`] vectors. `exec::execute_with_teardown`
//!    resolves the auto-rollback boundary with
//!    `ops.iter().position(|op| op.label() == boundary_label)` — the FIRST match —
//!    so a flat fleet-wide vector would classify every later host's *pre*-flip
//!    failure as post-boundary and silently disable teardown, leaving a candidate
//!    half-installed with no rollback. [`host_ops`] therefore returns one vector
//!    per [`HostPlan`], and `every_fleet_host_vector_carries_exactly_one_boundary_label`
//!    is the tripwire.
//!
//! 2. **Host identity NEVER enters [`exec::RemoteCommand::label`].** Labels are
//!    `&'static str` and are load-bearing three times over: the boundary lookup
//!    above, `CandidateRolledBack { failed_step }`, and every exact-vector test.
//!    Making a label host-specific would need a `Box::leak` (an unbounded
//!    per-host-per-run leak with non-deterministic identity that clippy will not
//!    flag) and would break boundary matching. The host travels in this module's
//!    plan/result types — never in an op.
//!
//! 3. **Exactly ONE `release_id` per fleet run.** It is minted once by the driver
//!    and threaded into every host's builders, so every host's `current` symlink
//!    resolves to the same release, drift reporting is meaningful, and a rollback
//!    has a single target. Regenerating per host would give un-comparable version
//!    identities and permanent reported drift.
//!
//! The migration is scheduled by [`migrate_placement`]: the FIRST host in rollout
//! order, whatever its mode. Since #1607's AC-3 fix both per-host builders carry a
//! migrate op, so the earliest possible placement is also the safest one — the
//! schema moves before ANY host in the fleet cuts over. Every other host builds
//! with [`exec::MigrateStep::Skip`].

// Every item here is crate-internal by design (see the note on `mod fleet` in
// `deploy.rs`). In this bin-only crate `deploy` is a private module, so clippy
// flags each `pub(crate)` as redundant; they are kept to document the intended
// visibility rather than widening to `pub`.
