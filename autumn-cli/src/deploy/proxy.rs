//! Reverse-proxy control for zero-downtime cutover (issue #1607, Slice 2).
//!
//! The public port is fronted by a reverse proxy; each app release binds a
//! PRIVATE loopback port. A redeploy stands the new release up on a *separate*
//! loopback port, health-checks it, then asks the proxy to atomically swap live
//! traffic from the old upstream to the new one and drain the old — this is the
//! cutover.
//!
//! ## What is real here
//!
//! - The [`ProxyController`] trait names the three operations the cutover
//!   orchestration needs — install the proxy, route it at an upstream (first
//!   deploy), and health-gated flip to a new upstream (redeploy). Each returns
//!   ordered [`DeployOp`]s that are driven over the injectable
//!   [`DeployExecutor`](super::exec::DeployExecutor) by
//!   [`run_ops`](super::exec::run_ops), so the exact remote command sequence is
//!   unit-testable without a live host.
//! - [`KamalProxyController`] keeps the exact `kamal-proxy` CLI invocations in
//!   ONE place: install prepares a supervised `kamal-proxy run` on the public
//!   port, and both the initial route and the health-gated flip are the same
//!   `kamal-proxy deploy <service> --target host:port` command — kamal-proxy
//!   blocks until the target passes its health check (pointed at the candidate's
//!   `/ready`), then atomically swaps and drains the old target.
//!
//! ## Swapping the proxy later (Caddy)
//!
//! The proxy is CONFIRMED as kamal-proxy for this slice, but the boundary is
//! drawn so a `CaddyController` could replace it without touching the cutover
//! orchestration in [`super::exec`]: it would implement the same
//! [`ProxyController`] trait with Caddy admin-API calls instead —
//! `route`/`flip` become `POST`/`PATCH` against `/config/...` (a `curl` op to
//! `http://127.0.0.1:2019/...`) and `ensure_installed` provisions the Caddy
//! service. Nothing outside this module encodes a kamal-proxy-specific shape.
//!
//! ## What is deferred
//!
//! - Live ssh is not exercised here (Slice 4's CI container harness).
//!
//! ## Host preparation (issue #1607, AC-1)
//!
//! [`ProxyController::binary_install_ops`] is how a controller PREPARES a bare
//! host: it returns the ops that install its proxy binary, and the deploy runs
//! them only when the compat probe reports
//! [`ProxyCompatFailure::binary_missing`]. [`KamalProxyController`] installs the
//! pinned [`KAMAL_PROXY_KNOWN_GOOD_VERSION`] build (see
//! [`KamalProxyController::install_shell`] for why it comes out of the container
//! image); a controller that ships its own binary inherits the `None` default and
//! is never asked to prepare anything.

        //     backend: a documented footnote, not a hard failure.

        //     can interpose between them. Because `--force` returns without waiting for
        //     readiness, the re-register succeeds on the first attempt in the normal case.

        //     in the brief window before the just-restarted proxy's socket accepts a
        //     connection.
