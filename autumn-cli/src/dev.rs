//! `autumn dev` -- watch for file changes and rebuild/restart the server.
//!
//! Orchestrates a development workflow:
//! 1. Compile the project with `cargo build`.
//! 2. Start the application binary.
//! 3. Watch source, config, migrations, and static assets for changes.
//! 4. Route each change to the cheapest valid action:
//!    - `cargo build` + restart for Rust/build changes
//!    - restart only for config and migration changes
//!    - Tailwind-only rebuilds for CSS input/config changes
//!    - browser reload only for plain static asset changes
