//! Scaffold support for threaded, polymorphic comments (issue #1367).
//!
//! `autumn generate scaffold post title:string comments:commentable` adds, on
//! top of the ordinary scaffold:
//!
//! 1. `comment_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` on the scaffolded model's own
//!    table — handled by the ordinary field pipeline, because the DSL token
//!    *is* that column (see [`super::dsl::FieldKind::Commentable`]);
//! 2. `#[commentable(by = User, counter_cache = comment_count)]` on the
//!    generated `#[model]` — emitted by [`super::model`]; and
//! 3. the **shared** `comments` table migration this module owns.
//!
//! # The comments table is shared, so it is emitted at most once
//!
//! That is the whole point of the polymorphic kind: a second commentable model
//! attaches to the same table under a different `commentable_type`. So this
//! module first looks for an existing `*_create_comments` migration in the
//! project and emits nothing when it finds one — which is what makes "add
//! comments to a second model" the DSL token and nothing else.
//!
//! The `CREATE TABLE` is deliberately **not** `IF NOT EXISTS`. A project that
//! already has an unrelated `comments` table (a `Comment` resource scaffolded
//! the ordinary way, say) is a real conflict the author has to resolve, and
//! `IF NOT EXISTS` would turn it into a silent no-op whose only symptom is a
//! `column "commentable_type" does not exist` at request time. Failing the
//! migration says so at `migrate`, where it is fixable.
