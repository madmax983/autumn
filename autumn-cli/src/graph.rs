//! `autumn graph` — query the application's architecture graph (issue #1747).
//!
//! Runs the app's own binary in architecture-graph dump mode
//! (`AUTUMN_DUMP_GRAPH=1`), reads back the graph the framework assembles from
//! every `#[route]`, `#[static_get]`, `#[model]`, `#[repository]`, `#[job]`,
//! `#[scheduled]` and `#[task]` in the binary, and answers structural questions
//! against it.
//!
//! Why run the binary rather than parse the sources: what an application
//! *contains* is a whole-binary, feature-resolved fact. A model declared in one
//! crate can be written by a route declared in another, or in a plugin the app
//! merely depends on, and link-time `inventory` collection is the only place
//! all of those registrations exist together. Same shape as `autumn data-flow`
//! (#1654), `autumn agents manifest` (#1691) and `autumn routes audit` (#1604).
//!
//! Three verbs:
//!
//! * `autumn graph show` — the whole graph, as a report or as JSON;
//! * `autumn graph touches <NAME>` — which routes and jobs reach a model, table
//!   or repository;
//! * `autumn graph impact <NAME>` — the transitive set a change to it would
//!   affect, repositories included.
//!
//! `--check` compares against a committed copy and fails on drift, which is
//! what makes a route quietly losing its access to a table — or a declared
//! element vanishing from the graph — something a reviewer must approve.
//!
//! See `docs/guide/architecture-graph.md`.
