//! `autumn migrate` -- run, inspect, or roll back Diesel database migrations.
//!
//! # Subcommands
//!
//! | Subcommand | Description |
//! |---|---|
//! | *(default)* | Apply all pending user + framework migrations |
//! | `status` | Show applied/pending status per migration plus rollback availability |
//! | `check` | Classify every `up.sql` and `down.sql` for rolling-deploy safety |
//! | `down` | Revert the most recently applied user migration(s) via `down.sql` |
//!
//! # User vs framework migrations
//!
//! **User migrations** live in `./migrations/` and are executed via the
//! `diesel` CLI (`diesel migration run`) or the Rust harness (for `down`).
//!
//! **Framework migrations** are embedded in the `autumn` crate and applied
//! through the Rust `MigrationHarness`. They are **forward-only**: `autumn
//! migrate down` never reverts them. Their forward-only contract is preserved
//! regardless of which user migrations are rolled back.
//!
//! # Database URL resolution
//!
//! Precedence (highest to lowest):
//! 1. `AUTUMN_DATABASE__PRIMARY_URL` env var
//! 2. `AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL` env var
//! 3. `DATABASE_URL` env var
//! 4. `database.primary_url` in `autumn.toml`
//! 5. `database.url` in `autumn.toml`
