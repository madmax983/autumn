//! `autumn migrate new` and `autumn migrate check-collisions`.
//!
//! Diesel records applied migrations **by version** (the leading
//! `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` directory prefix). When two differently-named migration
//! directories share one version, a fresh database applies exactly one of
//! them and records the version as done -- the other is skipped forever,
//! with no error anywhere. A skipped migration is not merely absent: a
//! constraint it was supposed to add will appear to exist in review and not
//! exist in the database.
//!
//! `autumn migrate new` (the preventive half) hands out a version that is
//! free everywhere this checkout can see: the working tree, every local and
//! remote-tracking git branch, and this CLI's own compiled-in framework
//! migrations. `autumn migrate check-collisions` (the enforcing half) is the
//! CI-time backstop for a collision this checkout could not see when the
//! migration was generated -- a branch pushed after, or a teammate's
//! concurrent PR.
//!
//! Neither command can see a *plugin's* migrations: those live inside a
//! compiled Rust crate, not a directory this checkout's git history
//! contains, and an app cannot be expected to coordinate versions with every
//! plugin author who might ship alongside it. That gap is closed at the
//! framework level instead -- every registered `EmbeddedMigrations` set
//! (framework, plugin, and app) is checked for cross-set version collisions
//! at app startup, and a collision is resolved automatically by
//! `autumn_web::migrate::compute_migration_disambiguation`, which gives the
//! losing migration a deterministic substitute version so both still apply,
//! regardless of whether the colliding authors ever coordinated.
