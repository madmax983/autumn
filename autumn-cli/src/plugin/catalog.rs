//! The install catalog: what `autumn plugin list` shows and what
//! `autumn plugin add` knows how to mount.
//!
//! Two sources feed the catalog, exactly as issue #1606 scopes discovery
//! ("crates.io plus the existing naming convention"):
//!
//! - **First-party** plugins ship as a static table compiled into the CLI.
//!   They are released in lockstep with `autumn-web`, so the CLI's own version
//!   *is* the version to install, and the mount snippet can be written down
//!   once and compile-gated in CI.
//! - **Community** plugins are discovered on crates.io through the documented
//!   `autumn-plugin-<name>` naming convention (see `docs/plugins.md`). Their
//!   mount is *derived* from the same convention and printed for the user to
//!   apply, never spliced in: nothing here can verify a third-party crate
//!   really exposes `<Name>Plugin`, and a wrong guess would leave the app not
//!   compiling.

/// One installable first-party plugin.
