//! `autumn plugin package` / `autumn plugin inspect` — the consent surface.
//!
//! A sandboxed plugin arrives as opaque bytes. These two commands are what turn
//! that into a decision an operator can actually make:
//!
//! ```text
//! autumn plugin package --manifest plugin.toml --module target/…/plugin.wasm \
//!                       --out hello.autumn-plugin
//! autumn plugin inspect hello.autumn-plugin
//! ```
//!
//! `package` binds a manifest to a module and stamps the module's digest, so an
//! author cannot ship a manifest that describes different bytes than the ones
//! in the box. `inspect` is the consent screen: what the plugin may do, what it
//! may not, which bytes were reviewed, every host function the module imports —
//! and a real verdict, because it loads the module into **the same sandbox the
//! runtime uses** and runs the same conformance checks `autumn plugin-check`
//! runs against a native plugin.
//!
//! Both refuse rather than warn. A plugin that would fail at the operator's
//! boot should fail at the author's desk.
