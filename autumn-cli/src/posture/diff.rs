//! The rules: what counts as *widening* an app's security surface.
//!
//! Every finding is derived from two manifests, never from source. A route is
//! identified by `(path, method)`; anything cosmetic — the handler's name, the
//! file and line it lives on, the module it was moved into — is invisible here
//! by construction, because a refactor that flags the security gate is a gate
//! nobody keeps.
//!
//! Two rules hold everywhere below, and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Every dimension is compared from both sides.** A fact that *disappears*
//!    from the head manifest is a fact that was lost. Walking only the head
//!    would miss it — and the manifest drops entries as well as changing them:
//!    adding `POST` to `security.csrf.safe_methods` turns CSRF validation off
//!    for every POST *and* deletes those routes from the csrf dimension.
//! 2. **Each finding carries a [`Finding::fingerprint`]**: the security-relevant
//!    delta, escaped, and the only field besides kind/method/path that reaches
//!    the acknowledgment digest. Human-facing `before`/`after` text stays out of
//!    it, so a later *narrowing* on an already-acknowledged route does not
//!    invalidate the acknowledgment, and no crafted route path can make one
//!    finding hash like two.
