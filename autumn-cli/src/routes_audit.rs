//! `autumn routes audit` -- prove route authentication coverage at build time.
//!
//! Runs the same dump-routes pipeline as [`crate::routes`], reads the
//! build-time security classification the framework attaches to every route
//! (derived from macro-expanded `#[secured]` / `#[authorize]` / `#[public]`
//! posture), and emits a stable-ordered, machine-readable security manifest.
//!
//! The command is a CI gate: it exits non-zero when any route is
//! `Unclassified` — i.e. a route that is neither framework-owned, guarded, nor
//! explicitly declared public — naming each offending route so the gap can be
//! closed by adding a guard or a `#[public]` marker.
//!
//! This is the first *dimension* of the security manifest described in issue
//! #1604; the `provenance: "provable"` tag on each classification lets #1627
//! grow additional dimensions without breaking the schema.
