//! The declarative-schema **diff engine** (slice 4 of tracking issue #1975).
//!
//! Given a **desired** state (the app's `#[model]` structs, lifted by the
//! slice-2 [parser](crate::schema::parse)) and a **baseline** (the checked-in,
//! dialect-tagged [snapshot](crate::schema::snapshot) from slice 3), this module
//! computes the pending migration — `desired − baseline` — as a structured
//! [`MigrationPlan`] and renders it as a diesel `up.sql` / `down.sql` pair.
//!
//! It is a **pure, DB-free, IO-free** library module: [`diff_schema`] is a pure
//! function of two in-memory schema states, [`guard_plan`] is a pure policy
//! check, and [`emit_up_sql`] / [`emit_down_sql`] are pure renderers. All IO
//! (loading the snapshot, parsing the models directory, writing the migration
//! files) lives in the command wiring ([`crate::schema::run`]'s `run_diff`), not
//! here.
//!
//! # Conservatism over completeness (the load-bearing rule)
//!
//! The slice-2 parser is a **partial** view of the schema: it documents three
//! gaps it cannot represent — (a) it never fabricates a `CHECK` for an enum
//! column, (b) only an explicit `#[references]` yields a foreign key (association
//! FKs are invisible), and (c) only convention `#[default]`s are recovered. A
//! migration derived from a partial desired state must therefore **never emit a
//! destructive op for a facet the parser simply cannot see** — doing so would
//! delete hand-written constraints that live only in the (richer) baseline.
//!
//! This module encodes that as the deliberate **absence** of `DropCheck`,
//! `DropForeignKey`, and `DropDefault` variants on [`SchemaChange`]: a baseline
//! check / FK / default absent from the desired side is treated as *unknown,
//! retained* — not *removed*. An enum column the parser skipped (recorded as a
//! [`SchemaDiagnostic`](crate::schema::parse::SchemaDiagnostic)) is likewise not
//! dropped. The **accepted trade-off** is that the diff is intentionally
//! conservative and will *miss* a genuine removal of one of those facets; that is
//! preferable to ever destroying parser-invisible or hand-written state, and the
//! genuine-removal case is recovered by later slices (`#[renamed_from]`, richer
//! parsing, a shadow-DB oracle).
//!
//! # Invisible `#[belongs_to(...)]` association foreign keys (offline limitation)
//!
//! The slice-2 parser cannot see a generated `#[belongs_to(...)]` association
//! foreign key: real generator output models it as a plain `<name>_id: i64`
//! column plus a **struct-level** `#[belongs_to(...)]` attribute, and the parser
//! lifts the `i64` field as an ordinary `Int64` column with `references: None` and
//! **no diagnostic** (only an *unresolvable field type* — a generated enum, or an
//! association written as a bare struct-typed field `pub user: User` — records a
//! [`SchemaDiagnostic`](crate::schema::parse::SchemaDiagnostic), and even that
//! carries no target-table). So the diff engine has **no offline signal** for the
//! presence, column, or target of an association FK. This produces two
//! consequences the engine handles conservatively:
//!
//! 1. **Adding a foreign key to a pre-existing column is refused**
//!    ([`DiffError::AddForeignKeyToPreexistingColumn`]). When a column present on
//!    both sides gains an explicit `#[references]` where the baseline recorded
//!    none, the baseline `references: None` is *unknown*, not proof the database
//!    lacks a constraint — the column may already carry an inline `REFERENCES`
//!    named `<table>_<column>_fkey` from the original association-FK generation, so
//!    a fresh `ADD CONSTRAINT <table>_<column>_fkey` would collide and the
//!    migration would not apply. The engine refuses (no override) rather than emit
//!    it; the fix is a manual migration or an authoritative re-snapshot. A
//!    **brand-new** FK column (an `AddColumn` whose `REFERENCES` renders inline) is
//!    safe and is emitted normally — there is no pre-existing constraint to hit.
//!
//! 2. **`DROP TABLE` cannot be checked against invisible inbound association
//!    FKs.** The inbound-reference scan ([`detect_inbound_fk_blocks`]) refuses a
//!    drop whenever a retained table holds a **visible** `references` to the
//!    dropped table (rounds 2/3/5, unchanged and still enforced). But an invisible
//!    `#[belongs_to(...)]` association FK on a retained table produces no
//!    `Column.references` and no diagnostic, so it cannot be detected offline —
//!    the resulting `DROP TABLE` (already `--allow-destructive`-gated) may fail to
//!    apply because the real `<retained>_<col>_fkey` constraint still depends on
//!    the dropped table. A precise guard is impossible without schema introspection
//!    (a future slice's shadow-DB / `--dev-url` oracle); a blanket "refuse every
//!    table drop" would make the common case useless and is deliberately **not**
//!    done. Instead every emitted `DROP TABLE` carries an advisory
//!    `-- autumn-safety:` comment naming this exact gap so the operator verifies
//!    (introspection or a manual FK drop) before applying. This is a documented
//!    limitation of the offline approach, not a bug.
//!
//! # Uniqueness is diffed only through indexes
//!
//! `Column.unique` is treated as informational metadata and is **not** separately
//! diffed. The slice-2 parser always emits a `unique` column together with its
//! `idx_<table>_<field>_unique` unique index, so the index set already carries
//! the uniqueness signal; diffing both would double-count.
//!
//! # Required-column additions need a default
//!
//! Adding a `NOT NULL` column **without a default** to an *existing* table is
//! refused ([`DiffError::RequiredColumnWithoutDefault`]): Postgres validates the
//! constraint against existing rows the instant the column is added, so the
//! `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... NOT NULL` fails on any table that already has
//! rows, and the offline diff engine has no backfill value to synthesize (the
//! safe nullable → backfill → `SET NOT NULL` sequence is a manual multi-step
//! migration). Give the field a `#[default(...)]` (including a synthesized one
//! like `created_at DEFAULT NOW()`) or make it nullable (`Option<...>`). A
//! `NOT NULL`, no-default column inside a brand-new `CreateTable` is fine — the
//! table is empty — and is not refused.
//!
//! Its exact sibling — turning an *existing* nullable column non-null
//! (`SET NOT NULL`) — is refused for the same reason
//! ([`DiffError::SetNotNullRequiresBackfill`]): Postgres validates the
//! constraint against every existing row the instant the `ALTER COLUMN ... SET
//! NOT NULL` runs, so it fails on any pre-existing NULL, and the offline engine
//! has no backfill value to synthesize. The only appliable form would pair a
//! default with a backfill, which is not expressible offline. The inverse
//! (`DROP NOT NULL`, making a column nullable) is always safe and is emitted
//! normally.
//!
//! # Generated identifiers must fit Postgres's 63-byte limit
//!
//! This engine derives some identifiers by unbounded interpolation — the foreign-key
//! constraint name `{table}_{column}_fkey` (`ADD CONSTRAINT` up, `DROP CONSTRAINT`
//! down — both derive it identically, so they always agree) — and emits the
//! parser-provided index names (`idx_<table>_<field>`) verbatim. Postgres silently
//! truncates any identifier to 63 bytes (`NAMEDATALEN - 1`). A generated name over
//! that limit is therefore (a) *silently renamed* on apply, risking a mismatch with
//! hand-written SQL that spells the untruncated name, and (b) a *collision* hazard:
//! if two generated names in the same migration share their first 63 bytes, PG
//! accepts the first `ADD CONSTRAINT`/`CREATE INDEX` and rejects the second as a
//! duplicate relation — an unappliable migration.
//!
//! The **engine-generated FK-constraint name** is purely internal (Postgres would
//! otherwise auto-name the constraint), so it is safe to rename: when
//! `{table}_{column}_fkey` would exceed 63 bytes it is passed through
//! [`bounded_pg_identifier`], which truncates the head and appends a short,
//! deterministic hex suffix (a digest of the full untruncated name) so the result
//! is a valid `≤ 63`-byte identifier. The **same** helper drives both the up
//! `ADD CONSTRAINT` and the down `DROP CONSTRAINT`, and the [`guard_plan`] length
//! check, so all three always agree on the emitted name. A short FK name (the
//! common case) is returned unchanged, so Postgres output is byte-stable.
//!
//! Parser-provided index names (`idx_<table>_<field>`) are **not** renamed — the
//! app spells them elsewhere — so [`guard_plan`] still refuses (no override — the
//! SQL is unappliable, not merely lossy) any Postgres plan that generates an index
//! identifier **longer than 63 bytes**, plus (defensively) any pair of generated
//! names that collide after truncation ([`DiffError::GeneratedIdentifierTooLong`]).
//! The check is **Postgres-only**: `SQLite` has no comparably short identifier
//! limit and does not truncate.
//!
//! # `SQLite` boundary
//!
//! Slice 5 renders both dialects. Postgres emits the direct `ALTER`-family
//! statements; `SQLite` — which has no `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` / `SET`/`DROP NOT NULL`
//! / `SET DEFAULT` / `ADD CHECK` / `ADD CONSTRAINT` — realises those via the
//! **table-recreate** strategy ([`emit_up_sql_with_context`]): `CREATE` a new table
//! with the desired shape, `INSERT .. SELECT` the surviving rows, `DROP` the old
//! table, `RENAME` the new one into place, and recreate the desired indexes,
//! wrapped with `PRAGMA foreign_keys` + a `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`. The recreate
//! needs a table's full desired (up) / baseline (down) shape, which the per-change
//! [`SchemaChange`] deltas do not carry, so it is threaded in via a
//! [`SchemaContext`]; the context-free [`emit_up_sql`] / [`emit_down_sql`] cover
//! Postgres and the portable `SQLite` subset (`CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`,
//! `ADD COLUMN`, `CREATE`/`DROP INDEX`) and return [`EmitError::SqliteRebuildUnsupported`]
//! if a `SQLite` rebuild is required without the shapes to build it.

/// match: a desired unique index over `{email}` is NOT satisfied by a baseline
/// *non-unique* index over `{email}` (it still emits `AddIndex`). Authoritative
/// diffs are unaffected — a brownfield constraint index shares its name on both
/// introspected sides and already matches by name, so real drift stays intact.
/// Whether the baseline table already carries a `unique` index whose covered

/// enforced by a differently-named brownfield constraint/unique index.
///
/// ## Why exact **key**-set-equality on a FULL, NON-PARTIAL index
///
/// Only a baseline unique index that actually enforces table-wide uniqueness of the
/// desired columns may suppress the `AddIndex`. Two catalog shapes look like they
/// cover the set but do **not**, and are deliberately rejected:
///
/// - A **partial** unique index (`… ON t(email) WHERE …`) enforces uniqueness only

///   the *expression*, not the column, so it does NOT guarantee `#[unique] email`
///   either. Introspection records an expression index with an EMPTY
///   [`Index::key_columns`], which is rejected.
