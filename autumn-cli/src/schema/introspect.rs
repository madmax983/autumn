//! Postgres database introspection into the [`autumn_schema_core`] schema IR —
//! the read-side of `autumn schema pull` (the first DB-introspection slice of
//! tracking issue #1975).
//!
//! Where [`crate::schema::parse`] lifts the **declared** `#[model]` structs into
//! the IR (the desired state), this module lifts the **live database** into the
//! same IR — a [`Table`] per public base table, with columns, primary keys,
//! unique/plain indexes, and single-column foreign keys — so a pulled snapshot
//! and the model-derived snapshot are directly diffable by the same
//! [`crate::schema::diff`] engine.
//!
//! # Design notes / fidelity
//!
//! - **Centralized type mapping**: every column type flows through
//!   [`ColumnType::from_pg_introspection`], which preserves an unmappable
//!   Postgres type as [`ColumnType::Opaque`] rather than dropping the column —
//!   introspection never silently loses a column.
//! - **Serial/UUID PK round-trip**: a single-column integer PK whose default is a
//!   `nextval(...)` sequence **that the column owns** is a `BIGSERIAL`-shaped id,
//!   which the model IR represents as an [`Int64`](ColumnType::Int64) PK with **no**
//!   default — so the `nextval` default is stripped to `None`. Ownership is required:
//!   a brownfield int8 PK backed by a *shared/custom* sequence it does not own
//!   (`id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('global_ids')`) keeps its raw default
//!   verbatim, so recreation continues allocating from that sequence rather than
//!   minting a fresh owned `BIGSERIAL`. A single-column UUID PK keeps its
//!   `gen_random_uuid()` default (the model parser records the same), so the two
//!   agree. See [`normalize_default`] / [`normalize_serial_pk_default`].
//! - **Redundant-cast canonicalization**: `pg_get_expr` renders a stored
//!   literal default with its cast (`'{}'::text` on a `TEXT` column) while the
//!   model parser records the bare literal (`'{}'`), so exact IR equality
//!   would report drift forever. A cast to the column's *own* Postgres type on
//!   a *literal* is never load-bearing and is stripped during
//!   [`normalize_default`], establishing one canonical form; a cast to a
//!   different type, a cast carrying a typmod, or a cast over a non-literal
//!   expression stays verbatim. See [`strip_redundant_default_cast`].
//! - **Uniqueness**: a single-column unique index sets the owning column's
//!   `unique` flag *and* is recorded as an [`Index`] (`unique = true`), mirroring
//!   how the model parser represents a `#[unique]` field, so a round-trip diff is
//!   empty. A *constraint-owned* unique index — the auto-created index behind a
//!   brownfield column/table-level `UNIQUE`/`EXCLUDE` constraint, which the
//!   declarative model DSL cannot express (it models uniqueness as unique
//!   *indexes*, not constraints) and which Postgres refuses to `DROP INDEX`
//!   independently of its constraint — is instead **retained verbatim** via its
//!   [`Index::definition`] (exactly like an expression/partial index), so a
//!   model-side diff never emits a rejected `DROP INDEX`. See [`collapse_indexes`].
//!
//! # Deferred blind spots (documented, not silently dropped)
//!
//! - **Long-identifier unique index names**: Postgres truncates (or hashes) an
//!   index/constraint identifier to `NAMEDATALEN` (63 bytes), but the model parser
//!   emits the un-truncated derived name. So a `#[unique]` field with a long name
//!   pulls back under the truncated DB identifier while the model side keeps the
//!   full one — a pre-existing parser gap that makes a round-trip diff non-empty
//!   for long field names. Introspection records the DB's identifier faithfully;
//!   reconciling the two names is a later slice.
//! - **Composite index key order**: multi-column index columns are ordered by
//!   `attnum`, not the true index key order. The model parser only ever emits
//!   single-column indexes (exact here), so this affects only hand-authored
//!   multi-column indexes; recording them faithfully but with attnum ordering is
//!   preferred over dropping them.
//! - **Operator classes / collations / ordering on *simple* indexes**: a plain
//!   column index with a non-default operator class, collation, or `ASC`/`DESC`
//!   ordering is still recorded by its columns (matching what the model parser
//!   emits), so those attributes are not separately normalized. Expression and
//!   partial indexes do not share this gap — they round-trip verbatim through
//!   [`pg_get_indexdef`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-info.html)
//!   (see [`Index::definition`]), so their operator classes/collations/ordering
//!   are preserved exactly.
//! - **Covering (`INCLUDE`) indexes are retained by definition**: a covering
//!   index (`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx ON t (a) INCLUDE (b)`, detected via
//!   `pg_index.indnkeyatts < indnatts`) is *not* a simple droppable index — its
//!   uniqueness scope is only the KEY column(s) `(a)`, but the `indkey`-derived
//!   column list mixes key and `INCLUDE` columns indistinguishably, and the model
//!   DSL cannot express the split. It is retained verbatim via
//!   [`Index::definition`] (like an expression/partial/constraint index) rather
//!   than rebuilt as a scope-widening `(a, b)` unique index, and never sets a
//!   single-column `unique` flag. See [`collapse_indexes`].
//! - **Composite / multi-column foreign keys**: only the first
//!   referencing/referenced column pair is recorded (the IR [`ForeignKey`] is
//!   single-column). The model parser never emits a composite FK.
//! - **Foreign-key / constraint names**: the IR [`ForeignKey`] carries only
//!   `table`/`column`, so the Postgres constraint name is not represented (and so
//!   never diffed).
//! - **Enum `CHECK` constraints**: enum recovery from `CHECK` expressions is a
//!   later slice; a `TEXT`-with-`CHECK` column pulls back as plain
//!   [`Text`](ColumnType::Text).
//! - **Non-PK `SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL` owned sequences**: a non-primary-key
//!   `SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL` column is preserved with its raw
//!   `nextval('..._seq'::regclass)` default so the pulled snapshot and `doctor`
//!   drift are faithful, but its owned sequence is not modeled; on rollback of a
//!   dropped table/column the down migration would fail with a missing-relation
//!   error rather than recreate the sequence. Owned-sequence / serial-identity
//!   modeling is deferred to a later slice (alongside views/triggers). The forward
//!   pull/doctor path is unaffected — it already round-trips the raw default
//!   verbatim; only the down-migration recreation of the sequence is out of scope.
//! - **Constraint-vs-index reconciliation for constraint-owned indexes**: an
//!   **EXCLUDE** constraint (`pg_constraint.contype = 'x'`) IS preserved as the real
//!   constraint: its retained `definition` is the
//!   `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT <name> <pg_get_constraintdef>` form
//!   (`EXCLUDE USING <method> (…)`), so a recreation
//!   re-establishes the actual exclusion rather than a plain index that would fail
//!   to enforce it (which would let overlapping rows through — a data-integrity
//!   loss). A brownfield `UNIQUE` (or PK) constraint-owned index, by contrast, is
//!   still retained by its *index* definition (`pg_get_indexdef`, a valid
//!   `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX …`), not by the originating
//!   `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT` — a recreation emits the `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` form, which enforces
//!   the same uniqueness, so exact constraint-*object* reconstruction for
//!   unique/PK constraints remains the documented deferral. A model that
//!   *also* declares `#[unique]` on a column already covered by a brownfield
//!   `UNIQUE` constraint is **recognized as satisfied** by the existing unique
//!   index: `diff_indexes` (model-diff path) treats a desired unique index whose
//!   exact column set is already enforced by any baseline `unique` index — including
//!   the retained constraint index — as fulfilled, so it emits **no** redundant
//!   `AddIndex` (and no `DropIndex`), and the plan is clean rather than tripping
//!   `guard_plan`'s unique-index dedup refusal. (This resolves the earlier
//!   "additively creates a redundant `idx_<table>_<col>_unique` index" caveat.)
//!   Full unique/PK constraint↔index reconciliation is otherwise deferred; the
//!   load-bearing property this slice guarantees is only that the generated
//!   migration no longer *fails* with a rejected `DROP INDEX`.
//! - **Cascade-dropped retained indexes on a dropped column**: when a model
//!   removes a column that a retained (`definition`-carrying) expression / partial
//!   / constraint-owned index depends on, Postgres cascade-drops that index with
//!   the `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` (the up path emits no `DROP INDEX`). The
//!   snapshot projection prunes it to match (so `doctor` / `pull --dry-run` do not
//!   false-drift) and the down migration recreates it from its verbatim
//!   `definition`. Whether a column is *depended on* is now detected **exactly**:
//!   a retained index carries in its [`Index::columns`] the precise `pg_depend`
//!   dependent-column set (key, expression-referenced, AND predicate columns) —
//!   the authoritative cascade set Postgres itself uses — so the diff engine tests
//!   dependency by exact set membership, never a `definition`-text scan (which
//!   could false-positive on a column name appearing in a string literal). One
//!   nuance remains deferred: a cascade-removed brownfield `UNIQUE` (or PK)
//!   *constraint* is restored on rollback as a unique *index* (via its
//!   `pg_get_indexdef` definition), not as the original named `CONSTRAINT` —
//!   functional uniqueness is preserved, exact constraint-object reconstruction is
//!   deferred. (An **EXCLUDE** constraint is not subject to this deferral: it is
//!   restored as the real `ADD CONSTRAINT … EXCLUDE USING …`, per the reconciliation
//!   note above.)
//! - **CHECK constraint `NO INHERIT` / `NOT VALID` suffixes**: dropped on
//!   recreation (the predicate is preserved; the suffix is not modeled).
//! - **`GENERATED ... AS IDENTITY` columns**: the identity generation clause
//!   (`information_schema.columns.is_identity` / `identity_generation`) is now
//!   **preserved verbatim** on [`Column::identity`] so the column round-trips a
//!   pull rather than flattening to a plain integer column. (Emitting the identity
//!   clause back out into recreated DDL is a later slice — the IR preserves it, the
//!   DDL emitter does not yet re-render it.)
//! - **PG15+ `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` unique indexes**: now **retained verbatim** via
//!   [`Index::definition`] — detected in the `pg_get_indexdef` text (version-safe on
//!   PG13/14, which never emit the clause) rather than via the PG15-only
//!   `pg_index.indnullsnotdistinct` catalog column — so the clause round-trips.
//! - **Stored/virtual `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED` generated columns**: pulled
//!   as ordinary columns; the generation expression
//!   (`information_schema.columns.generation_expression`) is not modeled, so
//!   recreation drops the computed-value behavior. Deferred alongside
//!   identity/owned-sequence modeling.
//!
//! Errors are **credential-safe** by construction: no variant ever embeds the
//! resolved database URL (only a parsed host/port on the connection-error path,
//! mirroring [`crate::db_pull`]).

// ===========================================================================
// SQLite introspection (`autumn schema pull` on the sqlite backend-flip)
// ===========================================================================
//
// Compiled only under the `sqlite` cargo feature (the backend-flip that must never
// be co-built with the default Postgres backend — see `autumn-cli/Cargo.toml`), so
// the default (Postgres) build references no `SqliteConnection` here. It lifts a
// live SQLite database into the SAME `autumn_schema_core` snapshot IR as
// [`introspect_postgres`], reading the SQLite catalog through `sqlite_master` and
// the table-valued `pragma_*` functions in a constant number of batched queries
// (one per catalog, joined against `sqlite_master` — never one query per table
// beyond what a PRAGMA inherently requires).
//
// # Fidelity / fail-closed posture (mirrors the Postgres arm)
//
// - **Type mapping is conservative**: SQLite type affinity maps to the IR
//   [`ColumnType`] only where unambiguous — INTEGER affinity → [`Int64`], TEXT →
//   [`Text`], REAL → [`Float64`], BLOB → [`Bytes`]. A NUMERIC-affinity (or otherwise
//   unmapped) declared type is preserved verbatim as [`Opaque`](ColumnType::Opaque),
//   never dropped, exactly like the Postgres arm's `Opaque` floor.
// - **Convention recovery** keeps a model↔database round-trip clean: a single-column
//   `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` id maps to an [`Int64`] PK carrying
//   `serial: Some(BigSerial)` (Autumn's `#[id]` convention; AUTOINCREMENT is detected
//   from the table's `CREATE TABLE` SQL because `sqlite_sequence` is empty until the
//   first insert), and a column defaulting to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` — the exact DDL
//   Autumn emits for a `Timestamp` `#[default]` column — is recovered as a
//   [`Timestamp`](ColumnType::Timestamp) with a [`ColumnDefault::Now`] default.
// - **Errors are credential-safe**: a connection failure carries only the parsed
//   file path; a query/PRAGMA failure is an [`IntrospectError::Query`] carrying only
//   the SQLite message — never the URL, and never a partial result.
//
// # Deferred (recorded, not silently dropped)
//
// - **Table-level `CHECK` constraints**: parsing a `CHECK (...)` predicate out of the
//   raw `CREATE TABLE` SQL text is deferred (SQLite exposes no catalog view for it,
//   unlike Postgres `pg_get_constraintdef`); `checks` is left empty for SQLite.
// - **`SERIAL` vs `BIGSERIAL` distinction**: SQLite has a single 64-bit rowid, so an
//   AUTOINCREMENT id is always recorded as `BigSerial` (there is no int4 serial).
// - **FK on-update/on-delete actions, composite FKs, expression/collation index
//   attributes**: same deferrals as the Postgres arm.
// - **Composite inline `UNIQUE(a, b)` constraints (#1975)**: a table-level
//   `UNIQUE(a, b)` produces a `sqlite_autoindex_*` auto-index whose name is
//   un-creatable (`SQLite` refuses `CREATE … "sqlite_…"`) and un-droppable, and the
//   IR has no table-level unique-constraint node — so it is skipped entirely (a rare
//   brownfield shape; the live constraint is untouched). A SINGLE-column inline
//   `col TEXT UNIQUE` IS modeled (folded into `Column.unique`, rendered inline on
//   rebuild/rollback so uniqueness is preserved). Deferred narrow edge: an
//   authoritative diff does not surface a MANUALLY-dropped single-column inline
//   `UNIQUE` (the fold's `Column.unique` change is not diffed — on Postgres the
//   equivalent drift is caught via the index diff).
// - **Generated columns' expressions**: generated columns are PRESERVED (read via
//   `pragma_table_xinfo`, never dropped), but their `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...)`
//   expression is not captured — a generated column round-trips as an ordinary column
//   of its declared type. Full verbatim re-emission is future work.
