//! The public site — WordPress's template hierarchy, as one front controller.
//!
//! WordPress resolves a request by matching rewrite rules into a `WP_Query` and
//! then picking a template file by filename convention. The two halves are
//! independent, which is why a permalink change can 404 content that is
//! plainly still there.
//!
//! Here one catch-all handler resolves the path with
//! [`crate::permalinks::resolve`] — the same function whose round-trip against
//! the permalink *generator* is unit-tested — and dispatches to a screen. There
//! is exactly one place that decides what a URL means.
