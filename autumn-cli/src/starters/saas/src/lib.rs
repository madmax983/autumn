//! A multi-tenant SaaS starter for Autumn.
//!
//! Signup → login → a tenant-scoped dashboard, composed from shipped Autumn
//! primitives: session auth (`Session` + bcrypt), and row-level multi-tenancy
//! (`#[repository(tenant_scoped)]` + `with_tenant`). Exposed as a library so the
//! integration tests in `tests/` can drive the real routes.
