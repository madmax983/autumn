//! The rewrite engine behind `autumn upgrade` (issue #1629).
//!
//! # Why tokens and not `syn` (or `sed`)
//!
//! The guide for 0.6.0 offers a `sed 's/\bwith_pool\b/…/g'` one-liner, which is
//! exactly the class of edit this command exists to stop shipping as prose: it
//! rewrites the word inside string literals, comments, and any same-named local
//! the app happens to own. Parsing to a `syn` AST and re-printing goes too far
//! the other way — it reformats the whole file and drops every comment.
//!
//! So the engine parses to a `proc_macro2::TokenStream` (which keeps
//! `span-locations` byte offsets into the *original* text), finds identifiers in
//! call position, and splices the replacement into the original bytes. Nothing
//! outside the renamed identifiers moves: whitespace, comments, and line endings
//! survive byte-for-byte.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not rewritten
//!
//! Tokens inside a macro invocation body or an attribute are reported as
//! `manual` with `file:line` rather than guessed at (issue #1629: "No site is
//! silently skipped"). A `foo! { … }` body is arbitrary input to arbitrary code
//! — the tokens that look like a call may never become one, and a macro is free
//! to build the identifier by concatenation, so a rewrite there is a guess.
