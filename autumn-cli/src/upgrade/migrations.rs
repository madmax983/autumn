//! The per-release registry of machine-applyable app-code migrations
//! (issue #1629).
//!
//! This is the app-code sibling of `autumn_web::config::DEPRECATED_CONFIG_KEYS`:
//! a static, reviewable table describing what each breaking release did to the
//! *user's own Rust source*, so `autumn upgrade` can apply the mechanical part
//! instead of every maintainer hand-editing call sites out of a prose guide.
//!
//! # Adding an entry
//!
//! One [`AppMigration`] per documented breaking change, including the ones no
//! codemod can touch — a [`Rewrite::GuideOnly`] entry is what makes the upgrade
//! summary *link* the guide section rather than staying silent about a break
//! the user still has to handle. `scripts/check-migration-guides.sh` reads the
//! [`id`](AppMigration::id) strings out of this file, so the guide's
//! `**Automation:**` label and the shipped codemod cannot drift apart.
