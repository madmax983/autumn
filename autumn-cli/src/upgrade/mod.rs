//! `autumn upgrade` — bring an app up to a release: its own code, and its
//! framework-owned project files (issues #1629 and #1593).
//!
//! Autumn ships every 2-4 weeks and, pre-1.0, most releases can break existing
//! apps. Issue #1588 made a written migration guide a release gate, but prose
//! left both halves of the actual work by hand: a purely mechanical rename like
//! 0.6.0's `with_pool` -> `with_pool_untracked` had to be applied call site by
//! call site, and the project skeleton `autumn new` wrote — `Dockerfile`,
//! `build.rs`, `autumn.toml`, the toolchain configs — stayed frozen at whatever
//! release scaffolded it, because bumping `autumn-web` updates the library, not
//! the project.
//!
//! This command closes both. For each release between the app's recorded
//! `autumn-web` version and the target, it applies that release's
//! machine-applyable migrations (see [`migrations`]) to the app's own source,
//! and reports everything it could not safely rewrite with `file:line` and a
//! guide link rather than guessing. In the same run it reconciles the
//! framework-owned project files against the current release's scaffold (see
//! [`scaffold`]), which never touches `src/` and never overwrites a file the
//! developer edited.
//!
//! # Safety posture
//!
//! - **Preview by default.** A bare `autumn upgrade` writes nothing: it prints
//!   a per-file diff and a count of affected sites. `--apply` is the explicit
//!   write step.
//! - **Plan first, then write.** Every file is read, parsed, and rewritten in
//!   memory before a single byte is written, so a parse failure halfway through
//!   cannot leave the tree half-migrated.
//! - **Idempotent.** Rewrites match whole tokens, so a second run finds
//!   nothing; an app that never used the affected APIs reports nothing to
//!   change.
//! - **Nothing silent.** A site the engine declines to rewrite (inside a macro
//!   invocation or an attribute) is listed under `manual` with its location.
//!
//! The same posture governs the scaffold half, one step further: a file whose
//! bytes no longer match the digest [`crate::new`] recorded when it wrote them
//! is a *conflict*, reported with its diff and never written.
