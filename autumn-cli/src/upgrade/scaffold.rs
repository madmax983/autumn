//! Framework-owned scaffold-file reconciliation for `autumn upgrade`
//! (issue #1593).
//!
//! `autumn new` writes a dozen framework-owned files into every project —
//! `Dockerfile`, `build.rs`, `autumn.toml`, the toolchain and style configs, the
//! CI workflow — and those templates keep evolving. Bumping `autumn-web` in
//! `Cargo.toml` updates the library, not the project skeleton, so an app
//! scaffolded on 0.5 keeps 0.5-vintage project files forever. This module is
//! the reconciler: it renders the *current* release's scaffold in memory,
//! compares it against what is on disk, and classifies every difference.
//!
//! # The question that decides everything
//!
//! "May I overwrite this file?" is really "did the developer touch it?", and
//! neither the file's contents nor its timestamp can answer that. So
//! [`autumn new`](crate::new) records a digest of every framework-owned file as
//! it writes it — the manifest at [`MANIFEST_PATH`] — and this module treats
//! that digest as the merge base:
//!
//! - on-disk bytes still match the recorded digest → the framework wrote them
//!   and nobody has since, so the new template may replace them ([`Status::Update`]);
//! - they do not match, or nothing was recorded → the developer may have edited
//!   the file, so it is a [`Status::Conflict`] and is never written.
//!
//! An app scaffolded before this feature existed has no manifest and therefore
//! no baseline. That is deliberately not an error: files it is missing entirely
//! are still offered ([`Status::Add`]), and everything else is a conflict for
//! review. Best effort, never a silent overwrite.
