//! Issue #1600 — known-vulnerable dependencies are blocked, by default, in the
//! CI `autumn new` scaffolds and on the framework's own release path.
//!
//! Three surfaces are covered here:
//!
//! * **Scaffold** — the generated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs a blocking
//!   dependency-advisory audit, and the generated project ships the advisory
//!   policy (`deny.toml`) that audit reads, waivers and all.
//! * **Framework release train** — the advisory gate that keeps an autumn-web
//!   release from shipping with an unwaived `RustSec` advisory, including the
//!   negative proof that the gate can actually go red.
//! * **Docs** — what the gate checks, how to read a failure, how to waive.
//!
//! Most of these assert on YAML and TOML that only ever executes in someone
//! else's CI. That is deliberate: a security gate that silently stops gating is
//! indistinguishable from a passing build, so the invariants have to be pinned
//! down here rather than discovered during an incident.
