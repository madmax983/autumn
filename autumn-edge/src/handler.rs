//! The type-system half of the edge capability check (AC-5).
//!
//! `autumn build` shells out to `cargo`, so the *compiler* is the enforcement
//! point for "this handler cannot run at the edge". [`EdgeHandler`] is the
//! bound that turns an unavailable extractor into an actionable message
//! instead of a wall of trait-resolution noise.
//!
//! ## Why a whitelist, not just `EdgeState`
//!
//! An early version bounded a handler on `axum::handler::Handler<T,
//! EdgeState>` alone — "must be an axum handler over the unit state" — and
//! nothing more. That bound is too open: axum's `Extension<T>` extractor
//! works for *any* state, so it satisfies `Handler<_, EdgeState>` too, even
//! though the capsule installs no request extensions except [`EdgeCache`](crate::extract::EdgeCache).
//! The same is true of the whole-`Request` extractor: it also works for any
//! state, and a handler that takes it can call `.extensions()` on it by hand.
//! Either shape compiles, passes locally against the origin (where the real
//! extension *is* present), and only diverges at the edge — a silent gap
//! between the two substrates, exactly what this crate exists to close.
//!
//! [`EdgeExtract`] closes it with a positive list instead: an edge handler's
//! parameters must each be one of the few extractors that behave the same
//! way on both substrates. Nothing outside that list satisfies
//! [`EdgeHandler`], whatever name or wrapper hides it — a type alias for
//! `Extension<T>` is still `Extension<T>` to the compiler, and the
//! whole-`Request` extractor is simply not on the list.
//!
//! A type alias does not hide `Extension<T>` from [`edge_get`]:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use autumn_edge::edge_get;
//!
//! type Hidden = axum::Extension<u32>;
//!
//! async fn handler(_ext: Hidden) -> &'static str {
//!     "never reached"
//! }
//!
//! let _ = edge_get(handler);
//! ```
//!
//! Nor does the whole-`Request` extractor, which could read `.extensions()`
//! by hand:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use autumn_edge::edge_get;
//!
//! async fn handler(req: axum::extract::Request) -> &'static str {
//!     let _ = req.extensions();
//!     "never reached"
//! }
//!
//! let _ = edge_get(handler);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the tuple check has two layers
//!
//! axum also implements its extractor traits for plain tuples, so a single
//! handler parameter can itself be a tuple of extractors
//! (`async fn h(combo: (Path<T>, HeaderMap))`). [`EdgeExtract`]'s own tuple
//! impls exist to accept axum's *handler-arity* tuple — the `(M, E1, ..,
//! En)` shape [`edge_get`]'s doc explains below — and that shape is, on
//! purpose, indistinguishable at the type level from a tuple a handler
//! author wrote by hand: both are "some type, followed by more types."
//! Judging each position with [`EdgeExtract`] itself (recursively) would
//! make that ambiguity exploitable: `(Extension<Hidden>, HeaderMap)` would
//! read as a valid handler-arity tuple with `Extension<Hidden>` sitting in
//! the free marker slot, smuggling it straight past the whitelist. Each
//! position is judged by [`EdgeLeaf`] instead — sealed, and (this is the
//! part that matters) never implemented with a free/unconstrained type
//! parameter anywhere, tuples included: [`EdgeLeaf`] does have tuple impls,
//! for a handler author's own `(Path<T>, HeaderMap)`-style grouping, but
//! every position in those still has to satisfy `EdgeLeaf` itself, all the
//! way down — so nesting one more tuple around `Extension<T>` still cannot
//! manufacture a leaf:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use autumn_edge::edge_get;
//!
//! type Hidden = axum::Extension<u32>;
//!
//! async fn handler(combo: (Hidden, http::HeaderMap)) -> &'static str {
//!     "never reached"
//! }
//!
//! let _ = edge_get(handler);
//! ```
