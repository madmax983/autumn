//! Everything an edge-safe handler module usually needs, and nothing that
//! would not compile at the edge.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use autumn_edge::prelude::*;
//!
//! async fn greet(Path(name): Path<String>) -> String {
//!     format!("hello {name}")
//! }
//!
//! async fn note(Path(key): Path<String>, cache: EdgeCache) -> String {
//!     cache.get_string(&key).unwrap_or_else(|| "miss".to_owned())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The list is short by design: an extractor that is not here is one the edge
//! cannot mediate, and reaching for it should be a compile error rather than a
//! surprise at deploy time.

// without them. `crate::reexports::http` is the escape hatch for the rest.
