Two crates in the workspace. `autumn-harvest` is the public library. `autumn-harvest-macros` is a separate proc-macro crate consumed by `autumn-harvest` via `prelude.rs`.

### Phase Status

- **Phase 1** (complete): types, error, event, policy, context stubs, models, macros, builder
- **Phase 2** (complete): event store, replay engine, workflow context, activity context, task queue (SKIP LOCKED), LISTEN/NOTIFY, worker runtime, heartbeating, timeout enforcement, workflow versioning (ctx.version), LRU workflow cache, dead letter queue, separate worker pool with shared ceiling, testcontainers integration tests
- **Phase 3** (next): DAG scheduler, DagBuilder, topological sort, #[dag] macro, trigger rules, timetable, signals/queries, saga pattern, management HTTP API
- **Phase 4**: production hardening -- sharding, sticky cross-worker routing, observability, metrics, dashboard (autumn-harvest-ui)

## Architecture

### Crate Relationship

`autumn-harvest` re-exports everything from `autumn-harvest-macros` through `prelude.rs`. Downstream crates depend only on `autumn-harvest` — they never add `autumn-harvest-macros` directly.

Macro-generated code must use `::autumn_harvest::` paths for everything. The proc-macro crate has no dependency on `serde_json` or `autumn-web` itself; it emits token streams that resolve via the `::autumn_harvest::` path. `lib.rs` re-exports `serde_json` at `::autumn_harvest::serde_json` and exposes `task_duration()` at `::autumn_harvest::task_duration` for exactly this reason.

Do not change macros to emit `::serde_json::` or `::autumn_web::` paths — downstream crates will not have those as direct dependencies and the code will fail to compile.

### Companion Function Pattern

`#[workflow]` generates a hidden companion function alongside the user's function:

```
pub fn __autumn_workflow_info_{name}() -> ::autumn_harvest::WorkflowInfo
```

`#[activity]` generates:

```
pub fn __autumn_activity_info_{name}() -> ::autumn_harvest::ActivityInfo
```

`workflows![name1, name2]` expands to `vec![__autumn_workflow_info_name1(), __autumn_workflow_info_name2()]`.

`activities![name1, name2]` expands to `vec![__autumn_activity_info_name1(), __autumn_activity_info_name2()]`.

### Key Design Decisions

**1. UUID PKs for execution IDs, not i64**

`ExecutionId`, `ActivityExecId`, and `HarvestTimer`/`HarvestSignal`/`DagRun`/`TaskQueueItem` all use `Uuid` as their primary key. Execution IDs must be generated before DB insert (distributed, shard-safe). The i64 convention for application domain tables does NOT apply here.

The `harvest_events` table is the exception: its `id` column is `BIGSERIAL i64` because events are strictly local and append-only — the sequence is never shared across shards.

**2. `db` feature gates all Diesel code**

`schema.rs` and `models.rs` are compiled only when `features = ["db"]`. `default = ["db"]`, so it compiles in by default. Tests on Windows run `--no-default-features` to avoid OpenSSL dependency. CI tests the `db` feature on Linux.

**3. Adjacently-tagged event JSON**

`WorkflowEvent` uses `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]`. This emits `{"type": "ActivityScheduled", "data": {...}}`. Postgres can extract the event type with `payload->>'type'` without parsing the full payload. Never change this tagging — stored events depend on it.

**4. Append-only event invariant**

Never remove or reorder `WorkflowEvent` variants. Stored JSON in `harvest_events.event_data` must always deserialize into the same variant names after deployment. Add new variants at the end.

**5. `WorkflowContext` replay modes**

`is_replaying()` returns the current mode. Normal mode: generate new events. Replay mode: return recorded results without re-executing side effects. The replay engine (Phase 2) will drive `set_replaying()` and manage the event history pointer. Phase 1 contexts always start in normal mode.

**6. `WorkflowHandlerFn` / `ActivityHandlerFn` are fn pointers**

Both types are `fn` (not `Box<dyn Fn>`). The macro generates a closure body cast to `fn` pointer. This keeps `WorkflowInfo` and `ActivityInfo` `Sync` without needing `Arc`. Serialization errors in the dispatch shim propagate as `Err(String)` — they are never swallowed.

**7. Multi-param dispatch packs into JSON array**

Single-param workflows/activities: input is passed as a single JSON value and deserialized directly. Multi-param: input is expected to be a JSON array `[arg1, arg2, ...]`, indexed by position.

| `workflow.rs` | `workflow_macro` — emits user fn + companion `WorkflowInfo` fn |
| `activity.rs` | `activity_macro` — parses `retry`, `start_to_close`, `heartbeat_timeout`, `schedule_to_start`, `queue` attrs; emits user fn + companion `ActivityInfo` fn |
| `collect.rs` | `workflows_macro` / `activities_macro` — expand to `vec![companion_calls...]` |

---

## Macro Usage

```rust
use autumn_harvest::prelude::*;

#[workflow]
async fn onboarding(ctx: &WorkflowContext, user_id: i64) -> Result<(), String> {
    // ... orchestrate activities
    Ok(())
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "30s", queue = "email-workers")]
async fn send_email(ctx: &ActivityContext, addr: String) -> Result<(), String> {
    // ... I/O, external calls
    Ok(())
}

let engine = HarvestBuilder::new()
    .workflows(workflows![onboarding])
    .activities(activities![send_email])
    .worker(WorkerConfig::default());
```

Supported `#[activity]` attribute keys:
- `start_to_close = "30s"` — duration string parsed by `task_duration()`
- `heartbeat_timeout = "10s"`
- `schedule_to_start = "5m"`
- `retry = RetryPolicy::exponential(3, Duration::from_secs(1))` — any expression
- `queue = "email-workers"` — task queue name

Duration strings: `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h"`. Parsed via `autumn_web::task::parse_duration` (bridged through `::autumn_harvest::task_duration`).

`#[workflow]` takes no attributes in Phase 1.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build without DB (works on Windows, no OpenSSL required)
cargo build -p autumn-harvest --no-default-features

# Build with DB (Linux/macOS with OpenSSL)
cargo build -p autumn-harvest

# Tests (no DB, works everywhere)
cargo test -p autumn-harvest --no-default-features
cargo test -p autumn-harvest-macros

# Tests with DB feature (requires running Postgres + OpenSSL)
cargo test -p autumn-harvest --features db

# Lint
cargo clippy -p autumn-harvest -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p autumn-harvest-macros -- -D warnings

# Format check
cargo fmt --check

# Format
cargo fmt

# Migrations (requires diesel-cli and a running Postgres instance)
cd autumn-harvest && diesel migration run
```

The `testing` feature in `autumn-harvest/Cargo.toml` gates `WorkflowContext::new_test()` and `ActivityContext::new_test()` for use outside `#[cfg(test)]` blocks (e.g., in integration test binaries).

---

## Adding New Workflow Types or Activities

1. Annotate the async function with `#[workflow]` or `#[activity(..)]`.
2. The function must take `ctx: &WorkflowContext` or `ctx: &ActivityContext` as its first argument.
3. Return type must be `Result<T, E>` where both `T` and `E` implement `serde::Serialize` / `serde::Deserialize` and `E: ToString`.
4. Add the function name to `workflows![...]` or `activities![...]` in the builder call.
5. If the activity uses shared state (DB pool, HTTP client), inject state through your own runtime wiring for now and access via `ctx.state::<T>()`; fluent `.state(value)` support is planned, not yet implemented.

## DB Schema Quick Reference

| Table | PK type | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `harvest_workflow_executions` | `Uuid` | One row per workflow run |
| `harvest_events` | `i64` (BIGSERIAL) | Append-only event log per execution |
| `harvest_task_queue` | `Uuid` | Pending/active work items for workers |
| `harvest_dag_runs` | `Uuid` | DAG run instances |
| `harvest_schedules` | `Uuid` | DAG cron/interval schedule config |
| `harvest_signals` | `Uuid` | Pending signals queued for delivery |
| `harvest_timers` | `Uuid` | Durable timers registered by workflows |
| `harvest_dead_letters` | `Uuid` | Tasks that exhausted all retry attempts |

`harvest_workflow_executions` is the hub — six tables join back to it via `workflow_exec_id`.

---

## Phase 2 Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `store.rs` | Event store (append/load history) |
| `replay.rs` | Deterministic replay engine (`HistoryMatcher`) |
| `executor.rs` | Workflow executor (`run_workflow` with replay + suspension) |
| `queue.rs` | Postgres task queue (SKIP LOCKED) |
| `notify.rs` | LISTEN/NOTIFY wrapper |
| `worker.rs` | Worker runtime (poll loop, semaphore-bounded dispatch) |
| `heartbeat.rs` | Batched heartbeat flusher |
| `timeout.rs` | Timeout enforcement scanner |
| `cache.rs` | LRU workflow state cache |
| `dlq.rs` | Dead letter queue |
| `pool.rs` | Separate pool configuration with shared ceiling |

cargo test -p autumn-harvest

# Integration tests (requires Docker for testcontainers)
cargo test -p autumn-harvest --test integration_e2e

# Replay tests
cargo test -p autumn-harvest --test replay_tests

# Macro tests
cargo test -p autumn-harvest-macros
```

---

## Design Decisions (Phase 2)

**DD-1: Oneshot suspension model**
Coroutine stays in memory; durability comes from the event history. When an activity is scheduled during live execution, the workflow function suspends via a oneshot channel. The executor re-invokes the workflow from the top on each replay cycle, replaying recorded events until it reaches the suspension point.

**DD-2: Separate DB pools with shared ceiling**
Worker pool and web pool are independently sized but share a total connection ceiling (`PoolConfig`). This prevents a burst of worker activity from starving HTTP request handling. `pool.rs` enforces minimum guarantees (at least 1 connection per pool) and distributes remainder to the web pool.

**DD-3: Workflow versioning via ctx.version()**
`WorkflowContext::version()` emits a `VersionMarker` event on first live call and replays the recorded version on subsequent runs. This allows workflow code to branch on version (`if ctx.version() >= 2 { ... }`) to handle non-determinism across deploys without breaking replay of in-flight executions.

**DD-4: Basic in-process LRU cache**
`WorkflowCache` is a bounded LRU cache for workflow state, keyed by `ExecutionId`. Cross-worker sticky routing (ensuring the same execution always lands on the same worker) is deferred to Phase 3/4. For now, cache misses just reload from the event store.

---

## Phase 3 Scope (next)

- **DAG scheduler**: `DagBuilder`, topological sort, `#[dag]` macro
- **Trigger rules**: timetable, signals/queries, saga pattern
- **Management HTTP API**: start/cancel/query workflow executions
- **`HarvestExt` trait**: planned integration to embed worker lifecycle into Autumn's `AppBuilder` (start/stop with the server)
