//! Resolve the identifier generated code should use in place of the literal
//! `::autumn_web` crate-root segment (issue #1828).
//!
//! Every route/derive macro in this crate emits thousands of `::autumn_web::…`
//! paths via `quote!`. Those paths are absolute (crate-root-anchored), so they
//! only resolve when the invoking crate depends on `autumn-web` under its
//! literal, unrenamed name — a crate that renames the dependency (`web = {
//! package = "autumn-web" }`) or that must host two differently-keyed
//! versions at once cannot use any Autumn macro.
//!
//! Rather than threading a resolved path through every `quote!` call site,
//! this module rewrites the *final* token stream each macro entry point in
//! `lib.rs` returns: every bare `::autumn_web` path segment is replaced with
//! the resolved name. The ~3000 `::autumn_web` references throughout the rest
//! of this crate never change; they keep meaning "the real `autumn-web`
//! crate, however the invoking crate's `Cargo.toml` names it." Only *tokens*
//! are rewritten this way, never string literal contents: a `::`-rooted path
//! is unambiguously a path reference wherever it appears, but a string
//! literal in the final expansion may be data the macro is simply re-emitting
//! verbatim from the user's own source (a route path, a doc comment, literal
//! text a handler returns) — blindly rewriting a substring inside it risks
//! corrupting that data on a false-positive match (Codex review, #2552).
//!
//! The handful of call sites that build a string *containing* a crate-rooted
//! path (`#[serde(deserialize_with = "::autumn_web::form::...")]`,
//! `#[serde(crate = "::autumn_web::reexports::serde")]`) instead read
//! [`current_target`] directly, so they construct the resolved string from
//! the start rather than needing a later post-hoc rewrite.
//!
//! Beyond generated code, several `autumn-macros` modules
//! (`idempotency_guard`, `agent_authority`, `mailer`, `ws`) *recognize*
//! `::autumn_web`-rooted paths — e.g. to detect that an earlier-expanded
//! stacked macro (`#[authorize]` before `#[secured]`) already injected a
//! particular guard call, so a later macro doesn't duplicate or miss it. Once
//! that earlier macro's own output has been rewritten to a renamed target,
//! recognizing it against the literal `"autumn_web"` breaks the same way
//! generation would (Codex review, #2552) — these also call
//! [`current_target`] instead of hardcoding the default.
//!
//! [`set_target`] is what makes the resolved name available to both: every
//! macro entry point in `lib.rs` calls it (via the returned guard's binding)
//! to cover its *entire* expansion, not just the later [`finalize`] pass —
//! recognizers run *during* the macro's own logic, inspecting input that may
//! already carry an earlier macro's renamed output.
//!
//! # Scope: an override rewrites the *whole* annotated item, not just
//! generated code (Codex review, #2552)
//!
//! `finalize` walks the macro's *entire* returned token stream, which
//! includes the user's own re-emitted function/struct — not only the
//! newly generated companion code — because the two are not structurally
//! separable in general (a guard macro like `#[secured]` interleaves
//! generated prologue statements into the user's own function body rather
//! than keeping the two cleanly apart). In the overwhelmingly common case
//! (automatic resolution, no explicit override) this is harmless and even
//! helpful: `::autumn_web` isn't a valid path *at all* once the dependency
//! is renamed, so any such path the user happened to hardcode themselves
//! needs exactly this same rewrite to keep working.
//!
//! It matters only for the explicit `crate = "..."` override — the
//! dual-version case, where `autumn_web` (unrenamed) and the override target
//! are simultaneously valid, distinct dependencies. An item that applies an
//! override and *also* contains the user's own fully-qualified `::autumn_web`
//! reference (intending the *other*, unrenamed instance) has that reference
//! rewritten to the override target too, potentially resolving to the wrong
//! instance. The guidance: don't mix explicit references to both instances
//! within one item that carries a `crate = "..."` override; give the
//! non-default instance its own distinct name in the reference itself
//! (whatever its own dependency key is) rather than writing bare
//! `autumn_web` and relying on it staying unrenamed.
