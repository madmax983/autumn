//! `#[agent_operable(grant = ...)]` — a compile-time authority envelope for
//! agent-callable handlers (issue #1691).
//!
//! An MCP-exposed handler is a tool an autonomous agent can call. What that
//! call is *allowed* to do — which models it writes, whether it may write
//! unbounded row sets, whether it may leave the tenant it was invoked for,
//! which hosts it may reach, which jobs it may enqueue, and how reversible the
//! whole thing is — is the security question the tool's description cannot
//! answer. This module turns the answer into a build-time artefact: a named
//! `Grant` (`autumn_web::agent_authority`) declared with `authority_grant!`,
//! and an analyser that walks the handler body, derives the effect set it can
//! prove, and fails the build when the grant does not cover it.
//!
//! The analysis forks `query_budget.rs`'s handle tracking, and departs from it
//! in one load-bearing way. Query counting is *fail-closed by construction*:
//! every statement that can reach the database names the request's `Db` handle,
//! so a handler that names no handle issues no queries. Three of this module's
//! five dimensions have no such chokepoint — `job::enqueue` reaches a global
//! client, `Client::new()` is constructible from nothing, and a webhook
//! dispatch fans out to subscriber-supplied URLs. So this analyser adds a
//! second, independent pass `query_budget` does not have: a **fail-closed
//! effect verb sweep**. `enqueue*`, `spawn*`, an outbound verb on an outbound
//! root and a webhook `dispatch` are effects wherever they appear, and their
//! subject must be a literal or the build fails. The default for those verbs is
//! *unprovable*, never zero.
//!
//! Effects the analyser proves are checked against the grant by a `const`
//! assertion respanned onto the offending call site, so the check works across
//! crates (const-eval sees the linked `Grant`, not the tokens) and still fails
//! `cargo build`. A raw diesel `SELECT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` is one of those
//! proved effects rather than an unreadable site: it carries no repository
//! tenant predicate, so it *reaches* across tenants, and only a `scoped` grant
//! refuses it. Anything opaque — a helper handed a tracked handle, a
//! `format!`-built URL — is a `syn::Error` naming the annotation that
//! discharges it, never a silent zero.
//!
//! The sweep's counterpart at the other end is the **awaited-call rule**. A
//! synchronous call handed no tracked handle cannot enqueue, write or call out
//! (and `spawn` is refused outright), but an awaited one needs no handle at
//! all: `start_finance_job().await` reaches the global job client and
//! `svc.notify().await` can build its own `Client`. So an awaited call the
//! analysis cannot read is refused. Readable means: rooted at a tracked
//! handle, carrying one as an argument, an already-swept verb (`enqueue*`,
//! `spawn*`), a constructor, or on the **inert-async allowlist** — which is
//! exactly:
//!
//! * `sleep`, `sleep_until`, `yield_now`, `timeout` (`tokio::time` /
//!   `tokio::task`); `timeout` awaits the future it is handed, so that future
//!   is judged at the `await` instead;
//! * chains whose root binding is named `session`, `flash`, `cache`,
//!   `cookies`, `cookie_jar` or `csrf`, or whose root parameter is typed
//!   `Session`, `Flash`, `CookieJar`, `PrivateCookieJar`, `SignedCookieJar`,
//!   `Csrf`, `CsrfToken` or `Cache…` (through any extractor wrapping it) —
//!   request-local plumbing that stores no rows a grant governs;
//! * `.commit()` / `.rollback()`, which end a transaction rather than acting
//!   through it;
//! * the guard prologue an attribute macro prepends — a call rooted at
//!   `autumn_web` whose function is `__`-prefixed, which is what `#[secured]`,
//!   `#[authorize]`, `#[step_up]` and `#[throttle]` emit ahead of the body.
//!
//! Everything else is discharged with `#[agent_effect(none, reason = "…")]`.
//!
//! Statement-level escape hatches: `#[agent_effect(writes(Model), ...,
//! reason = "…")]` declares a site's effects (they are still checked against
//! the grant — the hatch declares, it never grants), and
//! `#[agent_effect(none, reason = "…")]` discharges an opaque statement.
//!

// ── Shared with `query_budget` ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// This module forks `query_budget.rs`'s handle tracking (see the module doc
// comment), and most of what looks like a sibling function below has since
// diverged on purpose: `pattern_bindings`/`container_bindings`/`select_part`,
// `type_handle`, `is_constructor_call`, `signature_handles` and friends carry
// this analyser's richer `Handle` enum, where `query_budget` only needs a
// flat set of handle names. `INERT_MACROS` looks identical but is not — see
// the comment on `mac()` below for why `vec!`/`format!` are excluded here.
//
// A handful of items *are* still byte-for-byte copies, because they just
// enumerate `syn`'s own `Expr`/`Item` variants or do generic token-tree
// plumbing that owes nothing to either analyser's rules: `expr_attrs`,
// `expr_attrs_mut`, `item_attrs_mut`, `immediately_invoked_closure`,
// `call_path_name`, `tokens_contain_await`, `collect_pat_idents`, and the
// `StripAnnotations`/`VisitMut` impl, plus the `EXECUTORS` list above. Fix a
// bug in one of *those* and fix it in the other — `shared_helpers_match_query_budget`
// below fails the build if they drift. Two instances is not enough to extract
// them into their own module today (Echo's rule of three), so they stay
// duplicated on purpose rather than becoming a `handle_analysis.rs` nobody
// asked for.
