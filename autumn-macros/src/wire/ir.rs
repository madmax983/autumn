//! The wire descriptor — what one service endpoint puts on, and takes off, the
//! wire (issue #1755).
//!
//! `#[endpoint]` emits one of these per endpoint, both as a compile-time const
//! table in the callee crate and as a JSON build artifact. The artifact is the
//! machine-readable half: `#[contract_checked]` reads it back to name an
//! offending field in a diagnostic, and later slices diff two of them to reason
//! about a rolling-deploy window.
//!
//! Field names are recorded twice. `rust_name` is what a caller writes in
//! source; `wire_name` is what serde puts in the JSON. They differ under
//! `#[serde(rename)]` / `#[serde(rename_all)]`. Checks key on `rust_name`
//! because that is what a call site names; `wire_name` is carried for tooling.
