//! Small mesh (no-`SFU`) multi-participant call rooms and their `MediaMTX`
//! `WHIP`/`WHEP` signaling surface.
//!
//! A **room** is an ephemeral, in-memory rendezvous: participants join, each
//! publishes their own `WebRTC` track to a `MediaMTX` path and subscribes to
//! every *other* participant's path, forming a full mesh. Because the topology
//! is a mesh, each of `N` participants holds `N - 1` subscriptions —
//! `O(N * (N - 1))` connections room-wide — so the room is hard-capped at
//! [`config::DEFAULT_ROOM_MAX_PARTICIPANTS`](crate::config::DEFAULT_ROOM_MAX_PARTICIPANTS)
//! (6) participants. A selective-forwarding unit (`SFU`) that would lift that
//! cap is explicitly **out of scope** for this slice.
//!
//! # Isolation & `MediaMTX` paths
//!
//! Every participant maps to one `MediaMTX` path. The path carries an optional
//! `namespace` segment so two deployments (or tenants) sharing a `MediaMTX`
//! never collide:
//!
//! - namespace empty → `room/{room_id}/{participant_id}`
//! - namespace set → `room/{namespace}/{room_id}/{participant_id}`
//!
//! `room_id` and `participant_id` are server-minted v4 UUIDs (slug-safe), while
//! `namespace` is caller/operator-supplied and is the real guard target:
//! [`validate_room_segment`] rejects empty, `.`, `..`, and any character
//! outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` before a path is composed, so a crafted namespace
//! can never traverse the `MediaMTX` path space. Room lookups key on the
//! `(namespace, room_id)` pair and **fail closed**: a request under the wrong
//! namespace resolves to [`RoomError::RoomNotFound`], never another namespace's
//! room.
//!
//! # Security & host responsibilities
//!
//! The room signaling router ([`room_router`]) requires an authenticated Autumn
//! session to create or join a room (`POST {prefix}/rooms` and `POST
//! {prefix}/rooms/{room_id}/join` are `#[secured]`). Hosts must install the
//! framework's session middleware and authenticate callers before enabling
//! rooms. Hosts should also apply rate limiting: as a defense-in-depth backstop
//! against unbounded memory growth from a create loop
//! (a created-but-never-joined room is only reaped when its last participant
//! leaves), [`InMemoryRoomStore`] caps the registry at [`MAX_ROOMS`] rooms and
//! rejects further creation with [`RoomError::RegistryFull`] (mapped to a
//! transient `503`). The background reaper ([`spawn_room_reaper_loop`]) also
//! reclaims idle/created-never-joined rooms (see *Known limitations*), but the
//! cap remains the hard backstop — neither is a substitute for the host
//! auth/rate-limit layer.
//!
//! # Operator requirements
//!
//! - **`MediaMTX` path matcher**: this crate ships no `mediamtx.yml` (the
//!   template lives in the consumer app), so an operator enabling rooms must add
//!   a `path: "~^room/.+$"` matcher alongside the live `~^live/.+$` one, so
//!   `MediaMTX` accepts the `room/…` publish/read paths.
//! - **`CSP`**: an embedding page's `connect-src` must allow the `MediaMTX`
//!   `WebRTC` origin (`:8889` by default), exactly as the broadcast player does.
//!
//! # Peer discovery
//!
//! Peer discovery is by client polling of the member-gated roster
//! (`GET {prefix}/rooms/{room_id}`), not server push — there is no `WebSocket`
//! or `SSE` signaling channel in this slice. The join response seeds a client
//! with the peers present at join time; to pick up later joiners a client
//! re-polls the roster, which returns a subscribe target (`WHEP` URL) for every
//! current member. The roster is **member-gated and fail-closed**: only a caller
//! presenting a valid participant token for that room may read it (see
//! [`RoomStore::roster`]), because it hands out per-peer media endpoints.
//!
//! # Known limitations
//!
//! - **Client-driven participant reaping**: the reaper
//!   ([`spawn_room_reaper_loop`] → [`RoomStore::reap_stale`]) evicts a
//!   participant whose `last_seen_at` is older than the idle TTL, so a crashed
//!   client no longer holds a seat until process restart. Two signals refresh
//!   `last_seen_at`: an explicit [`heartbeat`](RoomStore::heartbeat), and a
//!   member-gated roster poll. A client that sends either within the idle TTL
//!   keeps its seat. Liveness is client-driven, not media-derived: a silent
//!   client is reaped even while its media flows. Reaping removes only the
//!   signaling record (seat + advisory token), never the live `MediaMTX`
//!   `WebRTC` path, so that client keeps streaming and can re-join. Deriving
//!   liveness from `MediaMTX` publisher state remains the follow-up.
//! - **Advisory token expiry**: `token_expires_at` is returned to the joiner but
//!   is **not** enforced anywhere yet (`MediaMTX` does not verify these tokens),
//!   so it never gates a lifecycle operation — a participant can always leave
//!   with a value-correct token regardless of its age.
//!
//! # Single-process limitation
//!
//! [`InMemoryRoomStore`] keeps all room state in process memory, so it is
//! **single-process only** — a multi-process / multi-replica deployment needs a
//! shared backing store. [`RoomStore`] is the swap seam for that: a networked
//! (and necessarily async) store would revisit these synchronous signatures.
