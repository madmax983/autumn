//! In-process reference [`SearchBackend`].
//!
//! Two jobs:
//!
//! 1. **The executable specification.** Every behaviour in the backend
//!    contract — ranking, pagination totals, fail-closed blank queries,
//!    idempotent upserts, filter semantics, k-NN ordering — is implemented
//!    here in ~200 readable lines, so a new engine implementor has something
//!    to diff against.
//! 2. **Infra-free tests and local dev.** An app (or this crate's own suite)
//!    gets complete keyword *and* vector search with no Postgres, no Docker,
//!    and no network.
//!
//! It is not for production: everything lives in one process's memory and
//! disappears on restart.
