//! The Postgres [`SearchBackend`] and [`DocumentSource`].
//!
//! Reuses the in-core FTS primitives from #842 — `to_tsvector` / `setweight` /
//! `plainto_tsquery` / `ts_rank_cd` — and adds vectors, with `pgvector` when
//! the extension is available.
//!
//! # Why a framework-owned index table
//!
//! Documents live in **one** table, `autumn_search_documents`, keyed
//! `(index_name, record_id)`, rather than in each model's own `search_vector`
//! column. That buys three things the per-table column cannot:
//!
//! - the index is **engine-agnostic** — swapping to Meilisearch changes the
//!   backend, not every model's migration;
//! - it is **observable and repairable** — you can count, diff, and purge the
//!   index without touching the system of record;
//! - a **backfill** and an incremental reindex write through the exact same
//!   path, so bootstrapping and steady state cannot disagree.
//!
//! The model's own `#[searchable]` column (and `#[repository(searchable)]`'s
//! `search()`) is untouched: this subsumes #842 as one backend, it does not
//! replace it.
//!
//! # Vectors: `pgvector` when present, portable when not
//!
//! `ensure_index` probes for the `vector` extension. When it is installed
//! **and** `search.embedding_dimensions` is configured, embeddings are written
//! to a `vector(N)` column with an ivfflat index and k-NN uses the `<=>`
//! cosine-distance operator. Otherwise they are written to a portable
//! `double precision[]` column and ranked with an `autumn_search_cosine()` SQL
//! function created by the same migration. Same API, same ordering, different
//! speed — so the plugin is deployable on a managed Postgres without
//! `pgvector`, and gets the fast path for free where it exists.

/// statement.
///
/// The guard goes on **both** arms, and the two failures are different:
///
/// - the `DO UPDATE` arm covers a record a concurrent reindex REWROTE — a
///   stale backfill batch would otherwise put the old text back;
/// - the insert arm covers one it DELETED. With the row gone there is no

///   something a user deleted. `autumn_search_deletes` exists precisely
///   because, once the document is gone, it is the only evidence the insert
///   path has that anything happened.
///
/// `INSERT ... SELECT ... UNION ALL SELECT ...` rather than a multi-row
/// `VALUES` when guarding, because `VALUES` admits no predicate and the
/// delete guard would have nowhere to attach. `ON CONFLICT` applies to the
/// unioned `SELECT` form just the same, and each arm can carry its own
/// `record_id` while all still sharing parameter slot `watermark_param` for
/// the watermark itself — bound once, not once per row.
