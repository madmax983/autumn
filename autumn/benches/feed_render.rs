//! Renders a realistic Atom feed of blog posts through `autumn_web::feed`,
//! the same `Feed::atom(...).entries(...)` shape `examples/blog`'s
//! `feed_xml` handler builds from real `Post` rows (title + full body as the
//! entry summary), so `valgrind --tool=callgrind|dhat` can attribute the
//! per-render cost of `Feed::render` and the private `escape` helper it
//! calls on every text field of every entry.
//!
//! The entry bodies are realistic prose paragraphs, not a stress payload:
//! mostly plain ASCII sentences, several containing an apostrophe/contraction
//! or an ampersand in the title (`escape`'s slow, character-escaping path),
//! most containing none of the five escaped characters at all (a candidate
//! fast path). This mirrors real blog content rather than gaming the
//! benchmark toward one path.
//!
//! Marginal per-render baseline (callgrind `--iterations 1000` minus
//! `--iterations 0`; dhat likewise): 382,993 instructions, 336 allocations,
//! 77.7 KB per `Feed::render` of the 30-entry feed. `feed::escape` is 53.8% of
//! self instructions.
//!
//! Like the other benches in this crate it is `harness = false` and asserts
//! nothing: it is a workload to point a profiler at.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo build --release -p autumn-web --bench feed_render
//! BIN=$(find target/release/deps -maxdepth 1 -name "feed_render-*" -type f ! -name "*.d")
//!
//! # Instruction profile
//! valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=callgrind.out "$BIN" --iterations 2000
//! callgrind_annotate --threshold=80 callgrind.out | head -60
//!
//! # Allocation profile (valgrind's built-in dhat tool — no crate dependency).
//! valgrind --tool=dhat --dhat-out-file=dhat-base.json "$BIN" --iterations 0
//! valgrind --tool=dhat --dhat-out-file=dhat-run.json  "$BIN" --iterations 2000
//! ```
//!
//! `--iterations N` renders the 30-entry feed N times after a fixed 50-render
//! warm-up.

    "We shipped named futures this week, a small change that makes async \
     stack traces dramatically easier to read when a request hangs. The \
     motivation came from a real production incident where the on-call \
     engineer spent twenty minutes staring at an unhelpful poll() frame \
     before finding the actual stuck task.",
    "A reader asked why we don't support connection pooling for SQLite the \
     same way we do for Postgres. The short answer is that SQLite's \
     single-writer model makes a traditional pool mostly pointless, but \
     it's a fair question and we've written up the reasoning in the docs.",
    "This release focuses on developer experience: faster incremental \
     builds, clearer error messages when a migration is unsafe, and a new \
     doctor command that catches common misconfigurations before they \
     reach production. Full changelog is linked below.",
    "Rust & WebAssembly keep coming up in our roadmap discussions. We're \
     not ready to commit to a timeline yet, but early prototypes of the \
     edge capsule runtime are promising enough that we wanted to share \
     progress publicly.",
    "Migrating a five-year-old Rails app to Autumn taught us a lot about \
     what scaffolding needs to generate by default. The biggest surprise \
     was how much time the team spent on admin CRUD screens that our \
     generator now produces in seconds.",
    "A short note on testing philosophy: we prefer integration tests that \
     exercise the real router over unit tests that mock half the stack. \
     It costs more compile time up front but catches an entire class of \
     bugs that mocks quietly paper over.",
    "The community call this month covered the new i18n fallback chain, \
     three community plugins worth checking out, and a lively debate about \
     whether the CLI should default to Postgres or SQLite for new projects. \
     Recording is up on the usual channel.",
    "Someone in the forum pointed out that our default rate limiter's \
     documentation didn't mention the per-token bucket size, so that's \
     fixed now. Small thing, but it's exactly the kind of gap that trips up \
     a first-time reader.",
