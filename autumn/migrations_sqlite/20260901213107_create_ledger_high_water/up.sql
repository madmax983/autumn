-- Per-record ledger high-water marks (issue #2323), SQLite variant.
--
-- Backend-forked from the Postgres migration in `version_history_migrations/`,
-- following the same convention as `20260826000000_create_ledger_revisions`:
-- the version dir name is kept identical so `__diesel_schema_migrations`
-- bookkeeping and `framework_migration_versions()` do not diverge across
-- backends. See the Postgres file for what the table is for.
--
-- Differences from the Postgres DDL:
--   * `recorded_at` is TEXT — the writer always binds it explicitly (there is no
--     server-side default), matching how `_autumn_ledger_revisions` stores its
--     own instants, so stored and filter values share one encoding;
--   * no `LOCK TABLE` — SQLite serializes writers on the database write lock, so
--     no append can commit between the backfill's SELECT and this migration's
--     commit in the first place;
--   * the backfill uses a correlated `MAX(seq)` probe rather than the Postgres
--     copy's `DISTINCT ON`, which SQLite does not have. The probe is served by
--     `idx_autumn_ledger_revisions_chain`, and SQLite deployments are
--     single-writer anyway, so the pass costs nobody else write availability.
