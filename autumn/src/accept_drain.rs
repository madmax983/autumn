//! Stop accepting before draining, so a just-accepted connection is served.
//!
//! `axum::serve(..).with_graceful_shutdown(signal)` does two things the moment
//! `signal` resolves: it stops calling `accept()`, and it tells every live
//! connection to shut down gracefully. hyper's HTTP/1 graceful shutdown
//! (`Conn::disable_keep_alive`) closes a connection *immediately* when it is
//! idle — and a connection accepted a few microseconds earlier, whose request
//! bytes are sitting unread in the socket buffer, is idle. So a request that
//! raced the shutdown signal was accepted, then closed with no response: the
//! client reads a clean EOF and zero bytes.
//!
//! That is rare on a normal SIGTERM, but an in-place upgrade (#1674) drains
//! the predecessor while the load keeps arriving on the shared listening
//! socket, so it is exactly the window every cutover opens. The hot-upgrade
//! live test caught it under coverage instrumentation, which widens the gap
//! between `accept()` and the connection task's first read.
//!
//! The fix separates the two steps. [`StopAcceptingOnShutdown`] stops handing
//! out connections the moment shutdown begins; [`drain_signal`] only then
//! waits [`ACCEPT_SETTLE`] before starting hyper's drain, long enough for a
//! connection accepted just before the stop to have its request read, which
//! turns it from idle into in-flight so the drain serves it. During an
//! upgrade the successor shares the socket, so connections arriving in that
//! window go to the successor; on a plain shutdown they wait in the kernel
//! queue exactly as they would have once `accept()` stopped anyway.
