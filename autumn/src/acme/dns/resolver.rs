//! Confirming that a published `_acme-challenge` TXT record is actually visible
//! in public DNS (issue #1620).
//!
//! A DNS-01 challenge fails — and burns an ACME authorization — if the CA
//! queries before the record has propagated. So after writing a record, autumn
//! waits until **every** configured resolver returns the expected value, bounded
//! by `[server.tls.acme.dns] propagation_timeout_secs`. The timeout error names
//! the exact record, value and resolver that never caught up, because "DNS-01
//! failed" without that is unactionable.
//!
//! # Why a hand-rolled query
//!
//! One question type (`TXT`), one class (`IN`), against explicit resolver
//! addresses — the answer parsing is ~100 lines and, unlike a stub-resolver
//! crate, it lets the wait be driven deterministically in tests against an
//! in-process UDP server. It is also the same code `autumn doctor` uses for its
//! DNS-01 preflight, so the check and the runtime agree by construction.
//!
//! This is a **DNS client for one narrow purpose**, not a resolver.
//!
//! # Why the probe goes to the AUTHORITATIVE servers
//!
//! The obvious implementation — ask `1.1.1.1` whether the record is there yet —
//! is quietly broken. The first probe fires the instant the provider's API
//! returns, which is *before* the record is live on the zone's own nameservers,
//! so the recursive resolver answers `NXDOMAIN` and **caches that negatively**
//! for the zone's SOA minimum (RFC 2308). Route 53 defaults to 900s and
//! Cloudflare to 1800s — both longer than the 300s propagation budget. Every
//! later probe then reads the cached negative answer, the wait times out, and
//! the next hourly attempt repeats it. Forever.
//!
//! So the configured `[server.tls.acme.dns] resolvers` are used to *discover*
//! the zone's authoritative nameservers ([`authoritative_resolvers`]), and the
//! propagation probe is sent to those directly with recursion **not** desired —
//! which is also what the CA effectively does. The configured resolvers remain
//! the fallback when discovery fails (a split-horizon setup, a resolver that
//! will not answer `NS`), because a recursive probe is still better than none.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.
