//! ACME issuance, the renewal loop, the self-signed placeholder, and the
//! observability seam (issue #1608).
//!
//! At boot the TLS listener needs *a* certificate to bind `:443` immediately.
//! If a valid certificate is already stored it is served; otherwise a
//! short-lived self-signed placeholder ([`self_signed_placeholder`]) is served
//! so the port comes up, and the background renewal task
//! ([`AcmeRenewalTask::run`]) obtains the real certificate over HTTP-01 and
//! hot-swaps it into the SAME [`ReloadableCertResolver`](crate::tls::ReloadableCertResolver).
//!
//! The renewal loop is spawned unconditionally whenever ACME is configured (a
//! pure `web` replica must renew its own cert). It leader-elects through the
//! existing [`SchedulerCoordinator`](crate::scheduler::SchedulerCoordinator) so
//! that, across a fleet, only one replica orders per certificate.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
