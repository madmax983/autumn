//! Per-tenant custom-domain issuance and renewal (issue #1635).
//!
//! [`crate::custom_domain`] owns the registry, the verification gate and the
//! issuance budget. This module is the half that needs a CA: the
//! [`AcmeDomainIssuer`] that orders one certificate per tenant hostname, and
//! the [`CustomDomainTask`] loop that drives every registered domain through
//! verify → issue → renew and offboards the ones an app removes.
//!
//! # Composition, not a second ACME client
//!
//! Orders reuse #1608's account, store and HTTP-01 token map through the
//! helpers extracted in [`crate::acme::renewal`]. One ACME account covers the
//! deployment's own certificate and every tenant's, so the CA sees one
//! registration however many domains connect.
//!
//! # Why HTTP-01 only
//!
//! A tenant's domain lives in the *tenant's* zone, so autumn holds no
//! credential that could write a DNS-01 `_acme-challenge` record there. The
//! verification gate already proves the hostname points at this deployment
//! (and, with the TXT token, that the tenant controls it), which is exactly
//! the condition that makes HTTP-01 work — so the challenge
//! the operator can actually answer is the one used, even when the
//! deployment's own certificate is issued over DNS-01.
//!
//! # Abuse posture
//!
//! Every order passes three gates first: the hostname is registered by the
//! app, DNS independently points here and carries the registration's TXT
//! token, and the
//! [budget](crate::custom_domain::IssuanceLimiter) has headroom. An SNI
//! hostname failing the first never reaches this module at all —
//! [`SniCertResolver`](crate::custom_domain::SniCertResolver) refuses the
//! handshake.
