//! Operator alerts connect Autumn's built-in failure signals to its existing
//! delivery channels — **with zero application code**.
//!
//! The signals reach the configured mailer and the signed outbound webhook
//! behind a small set of `[alerts]` config keys.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Autumn already knows when things go wrong: a job is dead-lettered, a health
//! indicator reports `Down`, the 5xx rate spikes, or a framework-scheduled task
//! fails. Historically an operator had to wire each of those signals to a
//! notification sink by hand. This module closes that gap: provide an operator
//! email and/or a webhook URL in `[alerts]` and every built-in condition is
//! delivered to you, deduplicated, with a recovery notice when it clears.
//!
//! ## Built-in alertable conditions
//!
//! | Condition | Fires when | Where to look |
//! |-----------|------------|---------------|
//! | [`AlertCondition::DeadLetteredJob`](crate::alerts::AlertCondition::DeadLetteredJob) | a background job exhausts its retries and is dead-lettered | `/actuator/jobs` † |
//! | [`AlertCondition::HealthIndicatorDown`](crate::alerts::AlertCondition::HealthIndicatorDown) | a registered health indicator reports `Down` past the grace period | `/actuator/health` |
//! | [`AlertCondition::HighErrorRate`](crate::alerts::AlertCondition::HighErrorRate) | the rolling 5xx rate crosses the configured threshold | `/actuator/metrics` |
//! | [`AlertCondition::ScheduledTaskFailure`](crate::alerts::AlertCondition::ScheduledTaskFailure) | a framework-scheduled task (backup, cert-renewal, cron/fixed-delay) fails | `/actuator/tasks` † |
//!
//! † `/actuator/jobs` and `/actuator/tasks` are mounted only when `[actuator]
//! sensitive = true` (default `false`). When it is off, those two alerts point at
//! the always-mounted `/actuator/health` instead and note that the richer
//! endpoint needs `sensitive = true` (see `sensitive_gated_where_to_look`).
//!
//! # Delivery is a trait (extension point)
//!
//! Every destination implements [`AlertChannel`](crate::alerts::AlertChannel). The [`Alerter`](crate::alerts::Alerter) holds a
//! fan-out list of channels and delivers each alert to all of them on a
//! detached task — so a slow or unreachable channel never adds latency to a
//! request or blocks the others. Two built-in channels ship:
//! [`MailAlertChannel`](crate::alerts::MailAlertChannel) (reuses the app's [`Mailer`](crate::mail::Mailer)) and
//! [`WebhookAlertChannel`](crate::alerts::WebhookAlertChannel) (a signed, Stripe-style HMAC POST reusing the same
//! signing scheme as [`webhook_outbound`](crate::webhook_outbound)).
//!
//! **Design intent (follow-up #1630):** PagerDuty / Slack / Discord transports
//! are added purely by implementing [`AlertChannel`](crate::alerts::AlertChannel) and registering them with
//! [`AppBuilder::with_alert_channel`](crate::app::AppBuilder::with_alert_channel);
//! the core never changes. That is why every [`Alert`](crate::alerts::Alert) carries a **stable dedup
//! key** ([`Alert::dedup_key`](crate::alerts::Alert::dedup_key), which PagerDuty correlates on), a **severity
//! class** ([`Alert::severity`](crate::alerts::Alert::severity)), and a **trigger vs resolve** discriminator
//! ([`Alert::event`](crate::alerts::Alert::event)).
//!
//! # Deduplication and recovery
//!
//! A sustained or repeating condition does **not** produce one notification per
//! occurrence. [`AlertDeduplicator`](crate::alerts::AlertDeduplicator) bounds notifications to **at most one per
//! condition per dedup window** (default 15 minutes); the condition re-notifies
//! once per window while it persists. When a previously-alerted condition
//! clears, a single [`AlertEventKind::Resolve`](crate::alerts::AlertEventKind::Resolve) recovery notification is sent.
//!
//! # Fail-safe
//!
//! Delivery is best-effort and off the request path: if a channel is
//! unreachable the app keeps serving, the failure is logged, and no latency is
//! added. See [`AppBuilder::with_alert_channel`](crate::app::AppBuilder::with_alert_channel)
//! and `docs/guide/operator-alerts.md` for the full guide.
