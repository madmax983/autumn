//! Structured audit logging with pluggable sinks.
//!
//! Audit logs are intentionally separate from regular application logs and
//! should capture security-sensitive, compliance-relevant actions.
//! Autumn models audit writes as append-only events sent to one or more
//! sinks (database, SIEM adapter, dedicated file, etc.).

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.
