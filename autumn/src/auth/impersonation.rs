//! Admin **user impersonation** — "log in as this user", without losing the
//! real admin's identity (issue #1394).
//!
//! Every support team eventually needs to reproduce a bug, verify a
//! permission, or walk a customer through a screen *as that customer*. Doing it
//! by hand — `session.insert("user_id", target)` — silently destroys the audit
//! trail: from that moment on every version row and audit event claims the
//! customer did it. This module is the primitive that makes the secure version
//! the easy one.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! [`begin_impersonation`] swaps the session's **effective** user to the target
//! and records the real admin separately under [`IMPERSONATOR_SESSION_KEY`].
//! Because the effective user lives in the ordinary auth session key,
//! everything the framework resolves "the current user" from — `#[secured]`,
//! [`RequireAuth`](super::RequireAuth), [`PolicyContext`] — transparently sees
//! the *impersonated* user, exactly as if they had logged in. ([`Auth<T>`] is
//! populated by the app's own loader middleware from request extensions, so it
//! follows only if that loader reads the auth session key.) Meanwhile the ambient
//! [current actor](crate::current::Current) — the value that seeds
//! `#[repository(versioned)]` version rows and audit events — is published as
//! the **real impersonator**, so writes made during the session stay honestly
//! attributed.
//!
//! [`end_impersonation`] reverses it, restoring the admin's user id and role.
//! Both directions rotate the session id (no fixation) and write an audit
//! event naming both parties.
//!
//! # Default-deny
//!
//! Beginning impersonation requires an [`ImpersonationGate`] installed in
//! [`AppState`]. With no gate registered every attempt is refused with `403` —
//! an app opts in explicitly:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use autumn_web::app::AppBuilder;
//! use autumn_web::auth::impersonation::ImpersonationGate;
//!
//! # fn wire(app: AppBuilder) -> AppBuilder {
//! app.impersonation_gate(ImpersonationGate::allow_roles(["admin"]))
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! `autumn-admin-plugin` wraps this in `AdminPlugin::with_impersonation(gate)`,
//! which registers the gate *and* mounts the begin/revert routes plus the
//! "Viewing as … — Stop impersonating" banner.
//!
//! # An audit sink is required
//!
//! [`begin_impersonation`] refuses with `500` unless the app has an
//! [`AuditLogger`](crate::audit::AuditLogger) with at least one sink installed
//! — `audit::write_from_state` is a silent no-op without one, and an
//! unrecorded identity swap is exactly what this module exists to prevent.
//! `AppBuilder::with_audit_sink(TracingAuditSink)` is the minimum; a durable
//! sink (`JsonlFileAuditSink`, or your own) is what you actually want. Ending
//! an impersonation is deliberately *not* subject to this: dropping privilege
//! must always succeed.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Session-based auth only: an API-token principal has no session to swap, so
//! the token authentication path is untouched. Same-tenant only — the
//! [`ImpersonationPolicy`] is the seam where an app enforces its tenancy
//! boundary (it receives the full [`PolicyContext`], including the session and
//! the DB pool) — the framework itself enforces no tenancy, and
//! [`ImpersonationGate::allow_roles`] in particular does not look at the target
//! at all, so a multi-tenant app wants a real [`ImpersonationPolicy`].
//!
//! Step-up does **not** carry over: [`begin_impersonation`] stashes the
//! operator's `last_strong_auth_at` claim and drops it from the impersonated
//! session, so a `#[step_up]` route cannot run a sensitive action on the
//! target's account on the strength of the *operator's* re-authentication.
//! [`end_impersonation`] restores the operator's own claim.
//!
//! # Reserved session keys
//!
//! [`RESERVED_SESSION_KEYS`] belong to the framework; do not configure
//! `[auth].session_key` to collide with them (impersonation refuses outright if
//! you do, and logs it at startup), and do not write them by hand. Call
//! [`clear`] from any flow that
//! replaces the session's user outright (a login, a magic-link or passkey
//! promotion) so a record left behind by an operator who never reverted is not
//! inherited by whoever logs in next.
//!
//! [`Auth<T>`]: super::Auth
//!
//! [`AppState`]: crate::AppState
//! [`PolicyContext`]: crate::authorization::PolicyContext
