//! Build-time cache-coherence proof (issue #1716).
//!
//! Autumn owns both ends of the staleness dependency: cached reads flow through
//! [`#[cached]`](autumn_macros::cached), the fragment cache and the read-through
//! cache; writes flow through [`#[repository]`](autumn_macros_repository::repository).
//! Until now nothing linked the two, so a cached value derived from `Post` rows
//! kept being served after a `PostRepository::save` inserted a new one and the
//! build said nothing.
//!
//! This module is the link. The macros publish what they know as `inventory`
//! descriptors — which models a cached read is derived from, which model each
//! repository write mutates, and which reads a write declares it invalidates —
//! and [`check`] proves, over the whole binary, that no mutation can strand a
//! cached value.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! A `(read, mutation)` pair is a **violation** when all four hold:
//!
//! 1. the read's dependency set is known (its provenance is not
//!    [`DependencyProvenance::Undetermined`]),
//! 2. neither side is acknowledged-stale,
//! 3. the read's dependency set intersects the mutation's model, and
//! 4. the mutation does not declare an invalidation naming that read.
//!
//! Reads whose dependency set could **not** be established are never failed by
//! the default gate — a checker that cries wolf gets deleted from CI. They are
//! reported as [`undetermined_reads`] instead, and `--strict` turns them into a
//! failure for an app that wants the stronger posture.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! A cached read is identified by its **cache-key namespace** —
//! `concat!(module_path!(), "::", <fn name>)`, the exact prefix
//! [`make_cache_key`](super::make_cache_key) already stamps on every entry. That
//! keeps the manifest's identity and the runtime's key space the same string.
//!
//! Models are matched on their **last path segment**, because the two sides
//! learn the name differently: a `#[repository]` always has the model *type* in
//! scope and publishes `core::any::type_name` (`blog::models::Post`), while a
//! dependency recovered from a `#[cached]` body may only be the bare ident
//! (`Post`). Two same-named models in different modules therefore
//! over-approximate — a false *failure*, never a false pass — which is the safe
//! direction for a coherence gate and is dischargeable with
//! `acknowledge_stale`.
//!
//! See `docs/guide/cache-coherence.md`.
