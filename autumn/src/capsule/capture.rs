//! The request-scoped capture buffer and the Tower layer that establishes it.
//!
//! [`CaptureLayer`] sits outer to
//! [`ReportingLayer`](crate::reporting::ReportingLayer) — the failure is not
//! known yet when the request arrives, so every request gets a
//! [`CaptureScope`] and the reporting layer decides at the end whether it is
//! worth writing. A scope is reachable two ways while the handler runs:
//!
//! * through the [`CAPSULE_SCOPE`] task-local, for effect sources deep in the
//!   stack that have no handle to thread (the clock);
//! * through a [`CaptureHandle`] in the request extensions, for the reporting
//!   layer, which must keep the scope alive across a panic unwind.
//!
//! Database recording cannot use the task-local (the pooled connection's I/O
//! runs on its own task), so scopes are additionally published in a
//! weak-reference registry keyed by capsule id; the connection recorder looks
//! its scope up by the id it read off the `SET autumn.capsule_request` marker.
