//! Writing capsules to disk, and reading them back.
//!
//! Capsules land in a plain directory of JSON files (`tmp/autumn-capsules` by
//! default, project-relative like the maintenance flag file). Because the
//! contents are real production request data, the writer is deliberately
//! conservative: owner-only permissions on unix, a temp-then-rename so a
//! reader never sees a half-written file, and an oldest-first prune so an
//! error storm cannot fill a disk.
//!
//! Retention errs towards keeping what a reporter is still reading, without
//! letting that instinct unbound the directory. `max_capsules` is clamped to
//! at least one, and pruning runs *before* the new capsule is written, so the
//! capsule this request just produced can never be the one deleted to make
//! room for it. A capsule handed to the reporting pipeline is **pinned before
//! its file becomes visible** ([`persist_pinned`]) and stays pinned until the
//! whole reporter chain finishes, so the path on an
//! [`ErrorEvent`](crate::reporting::ErrorEvent) always resolves — with no
//! window between write and pin for a concurrent prune to slip through.
//! A bounded [`PRUNE_GRACE`] additionally spares a *limited number* of the
//! newest over-cap files (cross-process writers have no way to see this
//! process's pins); the bound is what keeps a sub-minute failure storm from
//! accumulating an unbounded directory. The cap is a disk-space guard, not a
//! promise of an exact file count: the directory can briefly hold up to
//! roughly twice `max_capsules`, plus whatever reporters still hold pinned.
//!
//! Persistence is best-effort by construction. Every failure path logs and
//! returns `None`: a capsule that cannot be written must never turn a 500 into
//! a worse 500.
