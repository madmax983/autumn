//! On-disk shape of a failure capsule.
//!
//! A capsule is a single JSON document describing one failed request: the
//! (redacted) request that produced it, the clock readings the handler took,
//! the database traffic it generated, and the outcome the client received.
//! Everything here is `serde`-round-trippable and versioned by
//! [`CAPSULE_FORMAT_VERSION`] so a capsule recorded by one build is either
//! replayable by another or rejected outright — never silently misread.
//!
//! Byte-valued fields (wire frames, bind parameters) are base64-encoded so a
//! capsule stays a plain, diffable JSON file.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
