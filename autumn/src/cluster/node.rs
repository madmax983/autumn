//! The running node: identity, the push loop, the receive loop, and departure.
//!
//! [`ClusterNode::start`] is deliberately **app-independent** — it takes a
//! runtime config, an [`Entropy`](crate::entropy::Entropy), a
//! [`ClockSource`](crate::time::ClockSource), a [`CancellationToken`] and a
//! transport, and nothing else. That is what makes two whole nodes constructible
//! inside one test process, which in turn is what makes the deterministic
//! two-node suite possible at all. No process globals, ever.
//!
//! # Loops
//!
//! - **Push loop.** Every `push_interval` (± an entropy-drawn jitter, so two
//!   identically-configured nodes never lock step) it signs and sends the whole
//!   document to every known peer. The push *is* the heartbeat.
//! - **Receive loop.** Decode → verify → merge → update the local liveness
//!   overlay. Malformed input is dropped and counted; the loop never exits on a
//!   bad frame.
//! - **Departure.** Both loops select on the cancellation token. The cancel arm
//!   sends this node's final document (its own record marked `Left`, carrying
//!   every counter cell written since the last push) followed by a `Leave`,
//!   over existing connections and within a bounded budget (≤ 250 ms, inside
//!   the app's drain budget), and then exits. That whole path is only the fast
//!   one — the suspicion timeout is the correctness path.
