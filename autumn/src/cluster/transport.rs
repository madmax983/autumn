//! Peer transport: the swappable bottom of the stack.
//!
//! [`PeerTransport`] is deliberately tiny — send a frame to an address, receive
//! `(from, frame)` pairs, report the bound address — so the choice of TCP is a
//! *detail* rather than a commitment. Two implementations ship:
//!
//! - [`TcpPeerTransport`]: one listener, length-prefixed frames, per-peer
//!   bounded writer queues that **drop on full** (anti-entropy self-heals), a
//!   two-frame *departure lane* per peer that the writer reads first (the one
//!   frame anti-entropy never re-sends is the farewell), and a capped,
//!   entropy-jittered reconnect backoff.
//! - `LoopbackTransport` (test-only): an in-process router keyed by address, so
//!   two whole nodes run deterministically in one process with no sockets.
//!
//! # TCP connection state carries zero liveness meaning
//!
//! A live socket does not mean a live member and a dropped socket does not mean
//! a dead one. Liveness is application-level push receipt only
//! ([`super::membership::LivenessOverlay`]), and a per-connection error is
//! always `continue`, never fatal to the accept loop.
//!
//! # Shape of the TCP implementation
//!
//! Reads and writes are deliberately **not** multiplexed over one socket: the
//! accept loop's connections are read-only and each peer writer owns a
//! write-only connection it dialled itself. That keeps both halves trivially
//! total — a reader that hits EOF just returns and a writer that loses its
//! socket re-dials — and it costs nothing, because every frame is
//! self-describing and authenticated by its envelope rather than by the
//! connection it arrived on.
