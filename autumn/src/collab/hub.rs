//! Live collaborative sessions over the existing channel and presence seams.
//!
//! [`CollabHub`] keeps one live [`CollabText`] per collaborative field
//! instance — one note's body, one row's column. Editors join a document,
//! send operations, and receive every other editor's operations plus the
//! participant list and their cursors.
//!
//! # Where each part comes from
//!
//! | Concern | Seam |
//! |---|---|
//! | Operation fan-out | [`Channels`] topic `collab:{key}` |
//! | Who is editing | [`Presence`] topic `collab:{key}` |
//! | Cursor position | a `Cursor` message, merged into the participant list |
//!
//! The hub adds no transport of its own, so an app already serving
//! `#[ws]` routes gets collaboration on the socket it has.
//!
//! # Deployment: one process owns a document
//!
//! A document is owned by the process holding it. Run collaboration on a
//! single replica in this slice, or route every editor of one record to the
//! same replica.
//!
//! Two replicas sharing a Redis channel backend converge on the *text* —
//! operations flow both ways and the merge is order-independent — but three
//! things do not work:
//!
//! - **The participant list is per-replica.** [`Presence`] tracks membership
//!   in-process, so each replica broadcasts only its own editors and a client
//!   sees the roster flip between them.
//! - **The size limit is per-replica.** Two replicas can each accept a batch
//!   within [`CollabLimits`] and then merge the other's.
//! - **Persistence races.** Each replica writes the row from its own copy.
//!
//! # Authority
//!
//! The hub is the authority. A client sends an edit anchored to a **character
//! id**, never an index, so the hub places it correctly even when the document
//! changed in flight. The hub then broadcasts the resulting operations, and
//! every client applies them in the order they arrive.
//!
//! # Lifetime and persistence
//!
//! Nothing evicts a document on its own: once opened it stays in memory until
//! [`CollabHub::close`], which hands back the final state to persist. An app
//! that opens a document per record closes it when the last editor leaves.
//! Seed one from the database with [`CollabHub::open_with`] and write it back
//! with [`CollabDoc::document`].
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use autumn_web::collab::{CollabHub, CollabText};
//! use autumn_web::prelude::*;
//!
//! # fn wire(state: AppState, stored: String) {
//! let hub = state.collab().clone();
//! let Ok(doc) = hub.open_with("notes:42:body", || CollabText::decode_column(&stored))
//! else {
//!     return; // the registry is full; ask the caller to retry
//! };
//! let session = doc.join("session-1", "Ada");
//!
//! // ... apply client messages, broadcast operations ...
//!
//! // Persist whenever it suits the app (on idle, on leave, on a timer).
//! let column = doc.document().encode_column();
//! drop(session);
//! # let _ = column;
