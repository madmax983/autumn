//! Convergent conflict resolution for the offline-sync engine.
//!
//! The sync engine's default is last-write-wins: when two devices write the
//! same row, the older write is discarded. That is the right default for a
//! scalar column and the wrong one for a collaborative field, where both
//! writes are real text somebody typed.
//!
//! [`CollabResolver`] wraps another [`ConflictResolver`] and changes the
//! verdict for the named fields only: it merges the two documents and keeps
//! the wrapped resolver's answer for everything else in the row.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! use autumn_web::collab::CollabResolver;
//! use autumn_web::sync::{SyncBackend, server};
//!
//! # fn wire(backend: Arc<dyn SyncBackend>) -> axum::Router {
//! server::router(backend, Arc::new(CollabResolver::new(["body"])))
//! # }
