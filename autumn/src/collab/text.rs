//! An RGA text CRDT: the merge behind `#[collaborative]`.
//!
//! [`CollabText`] holds one text field whose concurrent edits merge without
//! loss. It is a Replicated Growable Array (a causal tree): every character
//! carries a globally unique [`OpId`] and the id of the character it was
//! typed after. Merge integrates operations; it never compares wall clocks
//! and never discards a write, so it converges where the offline-sync
//! engine's last-write-wins resolver loses data.
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! - **Convergence.** Replicas that hold the same set of operations render
//!   the same text, in any delivery order.
//! - **Causal safety.** An operation that arrives before the character it
//!   refers to waits in a buffer and integrates later. Nothing is dropped.
//! - **Idempotence.** Applying an operation twice changes nothing, so a
//!   client can safely replay after a reconnect.
//! - **Intention preservation.** An edit anchors to its neighbour character,
//!   not to an index, so it lands where the author meant even when the
//!   document changed in flight.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use autumn_web::collab::CollabText;
//!
//! let mut server = CollabText::new();
//! server.insert("server", 0, "hello world").expect("collab edit refused");
//!
//! // Two editors branch from the same state.
//! let mut ada = server.clone();
//! let mut linus = server.clone();
//! let from_ada = ada.insert("ada", 5, ",").expect("collab edit refused");        // "hello, world"
//! let from_linus = linus.insert("linus", 11, "!").expect("collab edit refused"); // "hello world!"
//!
//! // Each side receives the other's operations, in either order.
//! for op in from_linus { ada.apply(op); }
//! for op in from_ada { linus.apply(op); }
//!
//! assert_eq!(ada.text(), "hello, world!");
//! assert_eq!(linus.text(), ada.text());
//! ```
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Integration scans the element list, so a merge is linear in document
//! length and a full replay is quadratic. Deleted characters stay as
//! tombstones. This suits note-sized and comment-sized fields, which is the
//! scope of the first slice.
