//! Threaded, **polymorphic** comments (issue #1367).
//!
//! `belongs_to` / `has_many` / `has_one` / `through` all name exactly one
//! parent table in the child's foreign key. Comments do not work that way: one
//! `comments` table wants to attach to posts *and* photos *and* tickets. This
//! module is autumn's fifth association kind — the polymorphic one — keyed on a
//! `(commentable_type, commentable_id)` discriminator pair, with a `parent_id`
//! self-reference for threading.
//!
//! Declaring it is one attribute:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[autumn_web::model]
//! #[commentable(by = User, author_name = username)]
//! pub struct Post { /* … `comment_count: i64` … */ }
//! ```
//!
//! which emits `Post::COMMENTABLE_TYPE`, `Post::commentable_spec()`, a
//! `PostComments` trait (`add_comment` / `comment_thread` / `delete_comment`)
//! blanket-implemented over the generated repository, and an [`inventory`]
//! registration so [`router()`] can serve the thread for *any* commentable model
//! without the app writing a route per model.
//!
//! # Why there is no foreign key on `commentable_id`
//!
//! That is the known trade-off of the polymorphic pattern: a single column
//! cannot reference two tables. The framework write path is therefore the
//! referential check — [`add_comment`] probes (and row-locks) the parent row
//! before it inserts, so an unknown parent is a `404` rather than a dangling
//! comment. Nothing else in this module trusts `commentable_id`.
//!
//! # Counter maintenance
//!
//! `comment_count` is maintained by the counter-cache mechanism (#1325) — the
//! same atomic `UPDATE parent SET c = c + $1`, applied
//! **inside** the comment's own transaction, so a reader never sees a comment
//! whose count has not moved (or a count that moved without a comment). The
//! delete path decrements by the number of rows the cascade actually removed,
//! never by an assumed 1.
//!
//! # Identifier safety
//!
//! Every table/column name below arrives as a `&'static str` emitted by
//! `#[commentable]` and validated at macro time to be a plain identifier.
//! [`CommentableSpec::validate`] re-checks that on **every** call — in release
//! builds too, not just under `debug_assertions` — because the fields are
//! public and a hand-built spec is otherwise the one way past the macro's
//! guarantee. Every interpolated identifier is additionally quoted, the same
//! convention the counter-cache and `dependent(restrict)` codegen follow.
//! Values (bodies, ids, the discriminator) are always **bound**, never
//! formatted.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.
