//! Declarative counter caches (issue #1325).
//!
//! A counter cache is a denormalised `{child}_count` column on a parent row
//! that the framework keeps current: `posts.comment_count`,
//! `subreddits.subscriber_count`, `teams.member_count`. Declaring it on the
//! child's association —
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[autumn_web::model]
//! #[belongs_to(Post, counter_cache)]
//! pub struct Comment { /* … */ }
//! ```
//!
//! — makes the generated `#[repository]` maintain `posts.comment_count` on
//! every insert, delete, soft delete, restore and foreign-key reassignment,
//! **inside the same transaction as the row mutation**, with a single atomic
//! `UPDATE posts SET comment_count = comment_count + $1` (never a
//! read-modify-write, so concurrent inserts cannot lose updates).
//!
//! # Why the maintenance lives on the child
//!
//! The `#[model]` and `#[repository]` derives are separate proc-macro
//! invocations, so the repository macro never sees the model struct's
//! `#[belongs_to]` attributes — exactly the problem
//! [`crate::repository::AutumnDependents`] already solves for dependent
//! cascades. [`AutumnCounterCaches`] is the same bridge: `#[model]` emits an
//! *inherent* `counter_caches()` that shadows the empty blanket, and the
//! generated repository calls `Model::counter_caches()` by concrete path.
//!
//! Because the shadow is inherent, it is **not** visible through a generic
//! `M: AutumnCounterCaches` bound (a generic call would resolve to the blanket
//! default). Every helper in this module therefore takes the spec slice as an
//! argument rather than recovering it from a bound — call them as
//! `counter_cache_after_insert(conn, Comment::counter_caches(), &record)`.
//!
//! # Drift and repair
//!
//! Counters are not clamped: a drifted counter can go negative, and that is
//! deliberate — a negative count is a visible signal, where a silent `GREATEST(0,
//! …)` would hide the bug. [`counter_cache_recompute`] rebuilds the column from
//! the source of truth and is idempotent; the generated repository exposes it as
//! `recompute_counter_caches()` / `recompute_counter_caches_for(parent_id)`.
//!
//! # Identifier safety
//!
//! Every table/column name in the SQL below arrives as a `&'static str` emitted
//! by `#[model]`, and the only user-controlled one (`counter_cache = "…"`) is
//! validated at macro time to be a plain identifier. [`is_plain_identifier`]
//! re-checks that at run time under `debug_assertions` so a hand-constructed
//! spec cannot smuggle SQL through `format!`.
//!
//! On top of that, every interpolated identifier is [quoted](quote_ident) — the
//! same convention the `dependent(restrict)` codegen already follows. That is
//! what lets a counter column be named after a SQL keyword
//! (`counter_cache = "order"`) without turning every generated statement into a
//! syntax error, and it is safe precisely because the validation above rules out
//! the `"` that would otherwise escape the quotes.
