//! Unified data-retention policy for framework-owned data (issue #1605).
//!
//! Autumn creates and fills persistent stores the application never asked
//! for — the job queue and its tracking records, idempotency replay records,
//! sticky experiment assignments, webhook replay markers, sessions, audit
//! archives. Being batteries-included means owning their lifecycle, so this
//! module is the one place that:
//!
//! 1. enumerates every framework-owned dataset ([`RETENTION_DATASETS`]),
//! 2. resolves the window each one is actually kept for
//!    ([`effective_retention`]), reconciling the `[retention]` policy with
//!    the pre-existing per-subsystem TTL knobs,
//! 3. refuses to touch anything under a GDPR legal hold ([`legal_hold_for`]),
//! 4. runs the sweep ([`run_retention`]) — on a recurring in-process schedule
//!    ([`framework_retention_task`]) and on demand from
//!    `autumn db retention`, through the *same* code path so the report and
//!    the enforcement can never disagree, and
//! 5. writes an audit record for every run.
//!
//! Not to be confused with [`crate::retention`], which sweeps **app-defined**
//! models declared with `#[repository(..., retention(...))]` (issue #1342).
//! That module owns your tables; this one owns Autumn's.
//!
//! See `docs/guide/data-retention.md`.

/// a specific invariant another subsystem depends on:
///
/// - **`job_history`** matches only rows in a **terminal** state
///   (`completed`/`failed`/`discarded`) with a recorded `finished_at`, so a
///   job that is enqueued, running, or waiting on a retry is untouchable no
///   matter how old its row is (a retry goes back to `status = 'enqueued'`
///   with `finished_at = NULL`, see `job.rs`'s `pg_recover_stale_claims`).
///
///   It additionally never touches a row that still carries a **TTL-window
///   dedup key**. `#[job(unique, unique_for_ms = N)]` enforces its window
///   purely by the continued existence of the historical row — `job.rs`'s
///   `DEDUP_GUARD` matches `dup.enqueued_at > NOW() - N` with *no* status
///   filter, deliberately, so a completed twin still suppresses a duplicate
///   enqueue. Deleting that row would silently run the job twice. The row
///   itself does not record `N` (it is a compile-time `#[job]` attribute, not
///   a column), so there is no cutoff at which the sweep could safely take it;
///   it is retained until the key is cleared. See
///   `docs/guide/data-retention.md`.
///
/// - **`experiment_assignments`** matches only assignments belonging to an
///   `archived` experiment, or one whose experiment row is gone. A sticky
///   assignment is what keeps an actor on one variant while an experiment
///   runs: deleting it re-buckets the actor through the *current* weights,
///   which silently contaminates a running experiment's results and can also
///   admit the actor into a sibling experiment in the same exclusion group.
///
///   The boundary is restartability, not "finished". `ExperimentService::start`
///   restores a `draft` or `concluded` experiment to `running` and refuses only
///   `archived`, so `concluded` assignments are still live data — a sweep
///   followed by a restart re-buckets every returning actor. A deleted
///   experiment row is safe for the same reason in reverse: nothing can restart
///   it, so nothing can read those assignments again.
