//! Database connection pool and extractor.
//!
//! This module provides async connectivity via `diesel-async` with the
//! `deadpool` connection pool. The backend is whichever [`RuntimeConnection`]
//! resolves to — Postgres by default, `SQLite` under the crate's `sqlite`
//! feature. The pool is created at startup by
//! [`AppBuilder::run`](crate::app::AppBuilder::run) and stored in
//! [`crate::state::AppState`].
//!
//! When no `database.primary_url` or legacy `database.url` is configured,
//! [`create_pool`] returns `Ok(None)` and the application runs without a
//! database -- useful for static-site or API-gateway use cases.
//!
//! # The [`Db`] extractor
//!
//! Declare `db: Db` in your handler signature to get a pooled connection.
//! The connection is automatically returned to the pool when `Db` is dropped
//! at the end of the request.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use autumn_web::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[get("/hello")]
//! async fn hello(db: Db) -> AutumnResult<String> {
//!     // Use `db` with Diesel queries...
//!     Ok("hello from db".to_string())
//! }
//! ```

///
/// Only genuine application statements are timed. The dedicated

/// ignored outright. Crucially, diesel-async runs the transaction-control SQL
/// itself (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and the `SAVEPOINT`/`RELEASE`
/// variants for nested transactions) through `batch_execute`, which emits a
/// `StartQuery`/`FinishQuery` pair with that SQL — exactly like a real query.
/// Left unfiltered, a transaction wrapping a single `SELECT` would report
/// `desc="3 queries"` (BEGIN + SELECT + COMMIT) and fold begin/commit latency
/// into `db;dur`. Likewise [`Db::checkout`] issues a `SET statement_timeout`
/// housekeeping statement on every checkout, which would otherwise add a bogus
/// `+1 query` to every request before any app SQL runs. So at `StartQuery` we
/// inspect the statement text and skip timing when it is a housekeeping /
/// transaction-control command (see
/// [`RequestQueryTimer::is_uncounted_statement`]). Queries on a single
/// connection are strictly sequential (`&mut conn`), so a single
/// `Option<Instant>` slot is sufficient — there is no overlap between a start
/// and its finish, and skipping a start leaves the slot empty so the matching
/// finish is a no-op.
///
/// The timer is installed at [`Db::checkout`] (before the housekeeping `SET`)
/// **only when a `REQUEST_DB_TIMINGS` scope is active** — i.e. only for requests
/// the `ServerTimingLayer` is measuring. This gate matters because
/// `set_instrumentation` wholesale replaces the connection's instrumentation:
/// installing unconditionally would clobber any global default an application
/// registered via `diesel::connection::set_default_instrumentation` (query
/// logging, tracing, metrics), even when `server_timing` is disabled. Gating on
/// the scope leaves an opted-out app's instrumentation fully intact. When the
/// scope *is* active, installing a fresh timer per checkout also clears any
/// stale timer a pooled connection carried from a prior timed request. A stale
/// timer left on a connection later reused by an opted-out request is a cheap
/// no-op: `on_start` probes [`request_db_timing_active`] before doing any work,
/// so it never formats SQL or allocates off-scope.
///
/// Autumn does not currently *compose* with an app-registered
/// `set_default_instrumentation` — while `server_timing` is enabled its timer

/// upgrade fails with `SQLITE_LOCKED` / `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`, which bypasses

/// #2885). `SQLite`'s own docs call shared-cache mode "obsolete" and
/// "discouraged", recommending WAL mode instead — and WAL does **not** fix this
/// deadlock class (the table-lock protocol is orthogonal to the journal mode).
///
/// [`Db::tx_immediate`] only stops the participating writers from all reading
/// before their upgrade attempts — the first `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` takes the write
/// transaction up front. It is not a completion guarantee (a concurrent
/// reader's table lock can still fail that writer's write with
/// `SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE`), and it does **not** make the other writers
/// wait: under shared cache their `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` fails immediately,
/// since `SQLite` never invokes the busy handler for `SQLITE_LOCKED` (this pool
/// does not wire `sqlite3_unlock_notify`). Concurrent shared-cache writers
/// must therefore still be serialized, or retried with backoff (each attempt
/// through `tx_immediate`) by the application; the real fix is a WAL-mode file
/// database, where `tx_immediate` does queue on the busy timeout.

/// Autumn keeps supporting shared cache (the test suite uses it deliberately —

// DatabasePoolProvider — tier-1 boot-time replaceable pool factory
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Pluggable boot-time database pool factory.
///
/// Replace the default `deadpool + diesel-async` factory with a custom
/// strategy (custom metrics wrapper, circuit breaker, separate pools per
/// shard, etc.) by implementing this trait and installing it on the
/// [`AppBuilder`](crate::app::AppBuilder) via
/// [`with_pool_provider`](crate::app::AppBuilder::with_pool_provider).
///
/// The trait abstracts the *factory*, not the pool *type* — the return type is
/// fixed at `Pool<AsyncPgConnection>` for now. Swapping to a different backend
/// (e.g. `MySQL`, `SQLite`) would require generic `Pool<C>` propagation through
/// `Db` / `DbState` / `AppState` and is intentionally out of scope.
///
/// Providers that only implement [`DatabasePoolProvider::create_pool`] still
/// participate in primary/replica topology: the default
/// [`DatabasePoolProvider::create_topology`] uses the custom primary pool and
/// builds the configured replica role with Autumn's deadpool factory. Override
/// `create_topology` when both roles need custom construction.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use autumn_web::config::DatabaseConfig;
/// use autumn_web::db::{DatabasePoolProvider, PoolError};
/// use diesel_async::AsyncPgConnection;
/// use diesel_async::pooled_connection::deadpool::Pool;
