//! Credential redaction for configured database targets.
//!
//! Every database target Autumn is given can carry a secret, and several boot
//! paths print one: the config validator's "Invalid database URL", the pool
//! builder's backend refusals, the migration wait loop's connection errors, and
//! the startup config summary. All of them reach `tracing::error!` /
//! `tracing::info!`, so under `log.format = "json"` an unredacted target lands
//! in whatever ships the structured log stream.
//!
//! This module is the one redactor those paths share. It replaced three with
//! different behaviours (`app.rs`'s `mask_database_url`, `migrate.rs`'s
//! `redact_db_url_credentials`, `db.rs`'s `redact_pool_target`), the weakest of
//! which recognized only `postgres://` tokens and passed a
//! `mysql://user:pw@host` through untouched.
//!
//! It is deliberately NOT behind `#[cfg(feature = "db")]`: `config.rs`
//! validates database targets on every build.
