//! Maintained derived read models: `#[derivation]` (issue #1769).
//!
//! A derivation is a denormalised value on a parent row that the framework
//! keeps correct by construction: `posts.published_comment_count`,
//! `posts.visible_score`. Declaring it on the child:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[autumn_web::model(table = "comments")]
//! #[belongs_to(Post, fk = post_id)]
//! #[derivation(Post, column = "published_comment_count", filter = published)]
//! #[derivation(Post, column = "visible_score", transform = sum(score), filter = published && score > 0)]
//! pub struct Comment { /* … */ }
//! ```
//!
//! Every generated mutation path then maintains both columns inside the same
//! transaction as the row mutation.
//!
//! # Why this is the counter cache
//!
//! A derivation is a counter cache (`counter_cache`, #1325) with two extra
//! pieces: a per-row *contribution* (1 for a count, the field for a sum, 0 for a
//! row the filter rejects) and a *filter* lowered to SQL. `#[model]` emits both
//! into the same [`CounterCacheSpec`](crate::repository::CounterCacheSpec),
//! so the fifteen mutation paths the repository macro already dispatches to keep
//! derivations current with no new dispatch point. A plain counter cache is the
//! unfiltered special case, and its generated SQL is unchanged.
//!
//! # What this module adds
//!
//! A counter cache is correct from its first row, because the column and the
//! code that maintains it ship together. A derivation is usually declared over
//! a table that already holds data, so the existing rows have to be repaired.
//! This module owns that part:
//!
//! * **Content addressing.** [`DerivationDef::definition_hash`](crate::derivation::DerivationDef::definition_hash) hashes the
//!   lowered shape: tables, columns, transform, filter SQL. A changed filter
//!   changes the hash. A rename or a reformat does not.
//! * **Reconciliation.** [`ensure_derivations`](crate::derivation::ensure_derivations) compares each registered
//!   derivation's hash against `_autumn_derivations` and enqueues a backfill for
//!   the ones that changed. It leaves the rest alone.
//! * **Resumable repair.** [`run_backfill`](crate::derivation::run_backfill) rebuilds parents in checkpointed
//!   batches. Each batch is one transaction that locks the state row, pages from
//!   the checkpoint it finds there, repairs the page and advances the
//!   checkpoint. A killed process resumes, and several replicas cooperate on one
//!   sweep instead of racing.
//! * **Observability.** [`derivation_status`](crate::derivation::derivation_status) reports each derivation's state
//!   and its drift from the source of truth. `/actuator/derivations` serves it.
