//!
//! Stages `data` to a fresh, unpredictable sibling temp file, then `rename`s
//! it over the target, so a reader never observes a partial write and the
//! bytes are never briefly group- or world-readable. `rename` is atomic
//! within a directory, so a crash mid-write can never leave a torn file: the
//! target is either the old contents or the complete new contents.
//!
//! Used for ACME account/certificate material ([`crate::acme::store`]) and

//! must never be read half-written, and both used to carry their own copy of
