/// just backed off from instead of spreading the retry load. Drawing the
/// spread from the framework's injected [`crate::entropy::Entropy`] seam
/// breaks the synchronization — real OS entropy in production, seeded and
/// bit-for-bit reproducible under a [`crate::sim::Sim`] run — while keeping the
/// worst case no worse than the un-jittered delay (`delay <= base_delay_ms`),
/// so this changes no existing retry-timeout budget.

/// preserving the configured 1ms floor, and would do so on *every* attempt of
/// a job configured with a tiny backoff — silently turning it into a tight
