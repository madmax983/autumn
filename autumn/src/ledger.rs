//! Bitemporal, tamper-evident record ledger for `#[repository]` writes (issue #1699).
//!
//! This ledger records the **history of a row**. For money, see
//! [`crate::money::ledger`], which is a double-entry store with a balance
//! invariant. The two are unrelated.
//!
//! Autumn already records raw change history (`crate::version_history`, #700),
//! but a column-level diff log cannot be *queried as state*. This module
//! promotes that history to a ledger: every write to an opted-in entity appends
//! an immutable [`LedgerRevision`] carrying a **full row snapshot**, both time
//! axes (valid time and transaction time), and a hash linking it to the previous
//! revision of the same record.
//!
//! # Opting in
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[repository(Invoice, soft_delete, ledgered = true)]
//! pub trait InvoiceRepository {}
//! ```
//!
//! That single marker is the only per-model change required. `ledgered = true`
//! implies `versioned = true`, so every write path the version-history feature
//! already covers — hand-written handlers, generated `api = "…"` endpoints,
//! `#[job]`/`#[mailer]` paths, bulk saves, upserts, dependent cascades — appends
//! a revision automatically.
//!
//! # Querying the past
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Exact state at a past transaction instant.
//! let then = repo.ledger_as_of(id, last_tuesday).await?;
//!
//! // Field-level delta between two instants.
//! let delta = repo.ledger_diff(id, last_tuesday, now).await?;
//!
//! // Prove the stored history was never rewritten.
//! let report = repo.ledger_verify(id).await?;
//! assert!(report.is_intact());
//! ```
//!
//! # Bitemporality
//!
//! Each revision carries two instants:
//!
//! * `recorded_at` — **transaction time**: when the database learned the fact.
//!   Always set by the framework, from the *database's* clock at the point the
//!   append has read the record's chain head, and clamped so it never precedes
//!   the revision before it (#2323).
//! * `valid_from` — **valid time**: when the fact became true in the business
//!   domain. Defaults to `recorded_at`; a model can supply its own via
//!   `ledgered(valid_time = "effective_at")` on the repository.
//!
//! A revision's valid interval is `[valid_from, next_revision.valid_from)` —
//! derived at read time rather than stored, so no revision is ever updated after
//! it is written and the hash chain stays append-only.
//!
//! # Threat model
//!
//! The chain is **tamper-evident**, not tamper-proof.
//! [`verify_chain_with_high_water`](crate::ledger::verify_chain_with_high_water)
//! — which the generated `ledger_verify` calls — detects any mutation,
//! insertion, deletion, or reordering of stored revisions that does not also
//! re-derive every subsequent hash, plus a truncated tail and any write that
//! reached the table without appending a revision.
//!
//! (That link is written out in full because `lib.rs` puts an outer `///`
//! comment on `pub mod ledger;`: rustdoc concatenates it with this header and
//! resolves the whole block from the **crate root**, where only the re-exported
//! *types* are in scope — no free function is, which is why the
//! `monotonic_recorded_at` link below is written out too. A bare
//! `[`verify_chain_with_high_water`]` fails
//! `-D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`.)
//!
//! Three checks sit on top of the chain walk, each seeing something the walk
//! cannot:
//!
//! * the **live row**, compared against the head revision, catches a truncated
//!   tail and any write that bypassed the ledger — but only in the window before
//!   the next ordinary write lands;
//! * the **high-water mark** ([`LedgerHighWater`], #2323), which lives outside
//!   the deletable revision rows and never decreases, makes a post-truncation
//!   append allocate past the deleted sequence number instead of re-using it. A
//!   deleted revision therefore leaves a permanent gap rather than a window, and
//!   a wholly erased chain stops looking like a row that predates ledgering. The
//!   mark is cross-checked against the chain in both directions, so rolling it
//!   back, rewriting it or deleting its row is itself reported;
//! * **transaction time** is read from the database and clamped against the
//!   chain's own floor (see
//!   [`monotonic_recorded_at`](crate::ledger::monotonic_recorded_at)), so a
//!   `recorded_at` that moves backwards along a chain is a break rather than a
//!   plausible clock step.
//!
//! What none of them can see is a *consistent* rewrite: the hashing rule is open
//! source, so an adversary with write access to the ledger tables can re-derive
//! a whole chain, adjust the row to match, and re-establish the mark. The mark
//! raises the bar — the same attacker now needs `DELETE` on a second table and
//! has to keep it consistent — but it does not close the class.
//!
//! Nothing stored inside the same database closes that gap. Pin
//! [`LedgerHead::hash`] somewhere the database cannot reach — an append-only
//! object store, a notary, a second operator's inbox — and a rewritten or
//! re-numbered chain disagrees with the pin. For an audit posture that pin is
//! required, not optional.
//!
//! # Fidelity boundary
//!
//! A snapshot goes through the model's durable per-field codec, not
//! `serde_json::to_value`, so it carries every column — `#[private]` and
//! `#[encrypted]` fields included, which serde omits — and reconstruction is
//! byte-for-byte identical to what a live query would have returned at that
//! instant. Encrypted columns are stored as recoverable ciphertext, exactly as
//! the durable commit-hook queue stores them, and come back decrypted.
//!
//! Three consequences worth knowing:
//!
//! * Declaring `#[version_history(sensitive = [...])]` columns on a ledgered
//!   repository is a **compile error** — a redacted column could not be
//!   reconstructed, so the fidelity guarantee would be unprovable.
//! * `ledger_diff` compares the *reconstructed models*, not the stored bytes:
//!   an encrypted column carries a fresh nonce per write, so raw snapshots would
//!   report it as changed on every revision. A column the model hides from
//!   serialization therefore does not appear in a diff, though it is fully
//!   preserved in an as-of reconstruction and fully covered by the hash.
//! * The live-row cross-check in `ledger_verify` compares the durable codec
//!   projection of both sides, decrypted — so `#[private]` and `#[encrypted]`
//!   columns are covered there too. Only a column whose key is gone entirely
//!   drops out of that comparison.

/// at the point the append has already read the record's chain head — so the

/// revision's `recorded_at` and the high-water mark's, which makes transaction
/// time non-decreasing along a chain *by construction* rather than by
/// assumption — including across the gap a deleted revision leaves, since the
/// mark outlives the row.
///
/// Both sides are truncated to microseconds first, the precision both storage
/// tiers keep, so the value that enters the hash preimage is exactly the value
/// the database stores.
///
/// The clamp is **bounded**, and that bound is load-bearing. An unbounded
/// `max` would be a one-way ratchet driven by whatever `floor` says: a single
/// out-of-band `UPDATE` pushing a record's floor to the year 2999 would make
/// every subsequent revision carry — and *hash* — an instant in the far future,
/// which `verify` could not object to (the hash would be correct) while
/// [`snapshot_as_of`] silently stopped returning any of them. So a floor more
/// than [`LEDGER_MAX_CLOCK_SKEW_SECS`] ahead of the database's own clock is
/// refused rather than honoured: this returns `None` and the write path turns
/// that into a [`LedgerError::ChainUnreadable`]. Refusing writes something
/// nowhere; honouring it would hash an attacker's instant into the chain and
/// destroy the record's transaction-time history irreversibly.
///
/// Non-decreasing, deliberately, and **not** strictly increasing. Two revisions
/// of one record written inside a single clock tick — likely on `SQLite`, whose
/// `'now'` has millisecond resolution — share a `recorded_at`, and
/// [`snapshot_as_of`] resolves that by sequence number: an as-of query at that
/// instant returns the *last* revision recorded within it, which is what the
/// database held at the end of the instant asked about. That is the ordinary
/// semantics of a timestamp with finite precision, and no acceptance criterion
/// is bent by it: a revision sharing instant `t` was committed *at* `t`, not
/// after it.
///
/// Advancing past the floor by a tick instead would buy an unambiguous ordering
/// at two real costs. It would synthesise an instant the database's clock never

/// refused its writes. A coarse honest instant beats a precise invented one in
