//! Named, cluster-wide distributed locks backed by `PostgreSQL` advisory locks.
//!
//! Autumn already gates its own migrations, `#[scheduled]` leader election, and
//! ISR revalidation on `PostgreSQL` advisory locks, but those helpers are private
//! to their modules. [`Lock`] promotes that capability into a small, safe,
//! app-facing API for "run this exactly once across the cluster right now" work:
//! nightly cleanup sweeps, cache warming, one-shot backfills, or "send the daily
//! digest once".
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "db")]
//! # async fn demo(pool: diesel_async::pooled_connection::deadpool::Pool<diesel_async::AsyncPgConnection>) -> Result<(), autumn_web::lock::LockError> {
//! use autumn_web::lock::Lock;
//!
//! let lock = Lock::new(pool, "nightly-cleanup");
//! // Runs the closure on exactly one replica; the others observe `None` and
//! // skip. The lock auto-releases when the section ends (normal return, early
//! // `?`, or panic).
//! let ran = lock
//!     .try_with(|| async {
//!         // ... critical section that must not run twice ...
//!     })
//!     .await?;
//! if ran.is_none() {
//!     // Another replica holds the lock right now — nothing to do here.
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! The lock is a `PostgreSQL` **session-scoped** advisory lock. While the lock
//! is held, its [`LockGuard`] keeps the acquiring connection as a
//! **checked-out pooled connection** — counted against `database.pool.max_size`
//! and unavailable to other callers, but never handed back to the shared pool
//! while the lock is held, so the "recycled a lock-bearing connection and
//! leaked the lock" footgun cannot occur in application code. A clean release
//! runs `pg_advisory_unlock` and then **recycles** that connection back to the
//! pool for reuse; only the panic/cancel/unlock-error paths force-close the
//! session. Because a held lock occupies a pool slot for its whole duration,
//! holding N locks concurrently can never open more than `max_size` sessions —
//! keep critical sections short and size the pool for the locks you hold at
//! once.
//!
//! Acquisition is also **cancellation-safe**: the connection is held by an
//! internal guard across the acquire query, so if the acquiring future is
//! dropped mid-`await` (e.g. a surrounding request/task timeout) after
//! `PostgreSQL` granted the lock but before the guard took ownership, that
//! guard force-closes the session on drop — releasing the just-granted lock
//! rather than recycling a lock-bearing connection back into the pool. A
//! *definitive* miss (`try_lock` lost the race, or `lock_timeout` expired)
//! recycles the healthy connection with no churn.
//!
//! # Non-goals
//!
//! This is a *coordination* lock, not a durable mutual-exclusion queue:
//!
//! - **Not fair.** `PostgreSQL` advisory locks are not FIFO; waiters are not
//!   served in arrival order.
//! - **Not a lease.** There is no heartbeat/renewal; if the holder's connection
//!   drops, the lock releases. For long-lived leader election use the scheduler.
//! - **Not row-level.** Use `with_lock` (pessimistic) or optimistic locking for
//!   per-row contention; this is a *named*, row-independent lock.
//! - **`PostgreSQL` only.** Advisory-lock semantics assume `PostgreSQL`.
//!
//! # On `SQLite`
//!
//! The same API works under the `sqlite` feature, over a lease row in the app's
//! own database file rather than a `PostgreSQL` session lock (issue #1907). The
//! contract a caller relies on is the same — one holder at a time, released on
//! drop — with three differences worth knowing:
//!
//! - **The scope is one host.** Processes sharing the database file contend;
//!   two hosts do not. That is the whole `SQLite` tier, not this lock.
//! - **It is a lease, not a session.** The row carries an expiry, so a holder
//!   that dies frees the lock rather than wedging it. A live holder renews in
//!   the background, so a long critical section is not preempted.
//! - **It is not re-entrant.** A `PostgreSQL` session lock can be taken twice
//!   on one connection; a second [`Lock::try_lock`] on the same name in the
//!   same process observes `None`.
