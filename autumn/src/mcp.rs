//! Project typed Autumn endpoints as [Model Context Protocol][mcp] tools.
//!
//! Autumn already builds a route registry of [`ApiDoc`](crate::openapi::ApiDoc)
//! metadata — handler name, summary/description, and the request-body /
//! `Query` / path-param JSON Schemas — the same data that feeds
//! [`openapi`](crate::openapi). This module *projects* that registry into an
//! MCP server the way `openapi` projects it into an OpenAPI document, so an
//! existing JSON API becomes agent-callable with near-zero new code.
//!
//! What you write:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[get("/api/todos")]
//! #[api_doc(mcp, summary = "List todos")]
//! async fn list_todos() -> AutumnResult<Json<Vec<Todo>>> { /* ... */ }
//!
//! autumn_web::app()
//!     .routes(routes![list_todos])
//!     .mount_mcp("/mcp")        // serves a Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint
//!     .run().await;
//! ```
//!
//! Key properties (issue #1117):
//!
//! * **Opt-in per endpoint** via `#[api_doc(mcp)]`; nothing is exposed
//!   implicitly. A whole-API hatch ([`AppBuilder::expose_all_as_mcp`]) is an
//!   explicit, separate call and still requires opt-in for mutating verbs.
//! * **No second schema.** Each tool's `inputSchema` is derived from the
//!   handler's typed `ApiDoc`, so it cannot drift from the handler.
//! * **Real pipeline.** `tools/call` dispatches through the exact same router
//!   an HTTP request hits, so `#[secured]`, authorization, tenancy, rate
//!   limits, and validation all apply identically.
//! * **Bearer auth reuse.** Agents present an API token via the existing
//!   [`RequireApiToken`](crate::auth::RequireApiToken) surface; the
//!   `Authorization` header is forwarded into the dispatched call.
//!
//! Results are buffered by default. A tool tagged `#[api_doc(mcp, stream)]`
//! (issue #1118) returns an Autumn [`Sse`](crate::sse::Sse) stream that this
//! module projects onto the Streamable-HTTP SSE channel as
//! `notifications/progress` messages terminated by the final `tools/call`
//! result — see `serve_tools_call` / `stream_tool_result`. Streaming is
//! strictly opt-in per tool; the buffered path is unchanged.
//!
