//! Call-site facade for app-defined metrics (issue #1378).
//!
//! Recording an application metric should cost one line at the point where the
//! interesting thing happens — no traits to implement, no types to define, no
//! registry to wire into the app builder:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use autumn_web::metrics;
//!
//! metrics::counter("checkout_completed_total")
//!     .with_label("status", "paid")
//!     .increment(1);
//! ```
//!
//! Everything recorded here is exposed automatically by the actuator:
//! `/actuator/prometheus` renders the Prometheus text format and
//! `/actuator/metrics` renders the same data as JSON under a top-level `app`
//! key. Recording always works, and `actuator.prometheus = false` gates only
//! the Prometheus scrape endpoint — the JSON `/actuator/metrics` view still
//! carries the `app` key.
//!
//! ## Which instrument do I want?
//!
//! - [`counter`](crate::metrics::counter) — how many times something happened.
//!   Only goes up, name it `*_total`.
//! - [`gauge`](crate::metrics::gauge) — how many of something there are *right
//!   now*. Goes up and down.
//! - [`histogram`](crate::metrics::histogram) /
//!   [`timer`](crate::metrics::timer) — how long something took (or how big it
//!   was). Timers record seconds, so `histogram_quantile` works out of the box.
//!
//! ## Labels are a closed set
//!
//! Label values must come from a small, fixed set the code controls. Never
//! label with user input, IDs, or anything else unbounded: each distinct
//! combination of label values is a separate time series, and the facade caps
//! an instrument at [`max_series_per_metric`](crate::metrics::max_series_per_metric)
//! labeled series (samples carrying excess label sets are dropped and counted
//! in [`InstrumentSnapshot::dropped_series`](crate::metrics::InstrumentSnapshot::dropped_series)).
//!
//! ## Reserved names
//!
//! The `autumn_` prefix belongs to the framework's own built-in metric
//! families. Names starting with it — and names that are not valid Prometheus
//! metric names — are rejected with a warning, yielding an inert handle that
//! records nothing rather than panicking.
//!
//! A histogram additionally reserves its derived `_bucket`, `_sum` and
//! `_count` names, and the first registration of a name fixes its kind: asking
//! for the same name as a different kind is rejected the same way, so the
//! scrape output always carries exactly one `# TYPE` line per family.
//!
//! Narrative guide: `docs/guide/metrics.md`.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and

///   indistinguishable from a restart to `rate()`. An instrument already
///   holding more than the new cap simply accepts no *further* series.
/// * **Raising a cap takes effect at once**, including on an instrument or a
///   registry that is already full: the next new label set or metric name is
///   admitted rather than dropped.
/// * Changing `max_labels_per_series` changes **series identity** — the same
