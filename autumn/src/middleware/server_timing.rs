//! Server-Timing response header middleware (#1348).
//!
//! Emits a standards-conformant
//! [`Server-Timing`](https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/) header on
//! served responses when enabled by
//! [`ObservabilityConfig`](crate::config::ObservabilityConfig).
//!
//! The header carries at minimum a `total` metric (whole-request wall
//! time, measured with the same clock as the access log's `duration_ms`),
//! and a `db;dur=…;desc="N queries"` metric summarising cumulative query
//! time and query count when at least one instrumented DB query ran
//! during the request. The count is exposed via `desc` for N+1 visibility
//! in the browser's Network → Timing pane.
//!
//! The header is **off in production by default** and **on in the `dev`
//! profile**; see [`crate::config::server_timing_enabled`]. The middleware
//! is a no-op when disabled — it wraps the inner service directly and
//! never allocates.
//!
//! # Streaming responses
//!
//! Responses whose `content-type` is `text/event-stream` (SSE) carry only
//! the `total` metric. The `total` value reflects time to first byte —
//! response headers are flushed once the middleware returns — not the full
//! stream lifetime. Handlers that stream via other content types have a
//! full metric set attached; if the body's duration matters, prefer a
//! purpose-built metric emitted before the stream starts.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! `dur` values are milliseconds as `f64`, rounded to three decimal places
//! (`format!("{:.3}", …)`). The `total` metric uses the identical formula
//! as [`AccessLogLayer`](crate::middleware::access_log) —
//! `elapsed().as_secs_f64() * 1000.0`. Because this layer is applied outer
//! to the access log, its `total` brackets the access-log `duration_ms`
//! and the two agree within a few microseconds for the same request (the
//! access log does path-matching work between the two `Instant` captures).
//! See
//! `docs/guide/observability/server-timing.md` in the repository for a
//! browser `DevTools` walk-through.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.
