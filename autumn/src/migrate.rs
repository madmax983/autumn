//! Database migration support.
//!
//! Provides helpers for running Diesel migrations at application startup.
//! In **dev** mode, pending migrations run automatically; in **prod** mode,
//! they must be applied explicitly via `autumn migrate`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Application code typically does not use this module directly. Instead,
//! pass embedded migrations to [`AppBuilder::migrations`](crate::app::AppBuilder::migrations)
//! and the framework handles the rest:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use diesel_migrations::{EmbeddedMigrations, embed_migrations};
//!
//! const MIGRATIONS: EmbeddedMigrations = embed_migrations!();
//!
//! #[autumn_web::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     autumn_web::app()
//!         .routes(routes![...])
//!         .migrations(MIGRATIONS)
//!         .run()
//!         .await;
//! }
//! ```
