//! OpenAPI (Swagger) specification auto-generation.
//!
//! Autumn automatically infers an OpenAPI 3.1 document from your
//! annotated routes ([`get`](crate::get), [`post`](crate::post), etc.),
//! their path parameters, and the extractor / response types in each
//! handler signature. The generated spec is served at `/openapi.json` and
//! a Swagger UI is served at `/swagger-ui` when the feature is enabled.
//!
//! Narrative guide: `docs/guide/openapi.md`.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! Enable the `openapi` feature in `Cargo.toml`, then:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! autumn-web = { version = "0.2", features = ["openapi"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use autumn_web::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[get("/hello")]
//! async fn hello() -> &'static str { "hi" }
//!
//! #[autumn_web::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     autumn_web::app()
//!         .routes(routes![hello])
//!         .openapi(autumn_web::openapi::OpenApiConfig::new("My API", "1.0.0"))
//!         .run()
//!         .await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! With `.openapi(...)` enabled, the following endpoints are mounted:
//! * `GET /openapi.json` — serves the generated spec document.
//! * `GET /swagger-ui` — serves a Swagger UI HTML page loading the JSON
//!   above.
//!
//! # Enriching the auto-generated docs
//!
//! Decorate handlers with [`#[api_doc(...)]`](crate::api_doc) to override
//! or add documentation fields that cannot be inferred from the signature
//! (summaries, descriptions, tags, custom status codes, etc.):
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use autumn_web::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[get("/users/{id}")]
//! #[api_doc(summary = "Fetch a user by id", tag = "users")]
//! async fn get_user(_id: Path<i32>) -> &'static str { "user" }
//! ```
//!
//! # Custom schemas
//!
//! Types that need rich schemas (beyond the generic "object" fallback)
//! implement the `OpenApiSchema` trait and are registered with
//! `OpenApiConfig::register_schema`.
