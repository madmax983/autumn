//! Render server-side templates to downloadable PDF documents.
//!
//! [`Pdf`](crate::pdf::Pdf) turns an HTML string — typically a [`maud::Markup`] view you
//! already render on-screen — into a PDF document served with the right
//! `Content-Type: application/pdf` and `Content-Disposition` headers (via
//! [`Download`](crate::download::Download), which already handles RFC
//! 6266-safe filenames and the `inline`/`attachment` switch — see its module
//! docs for that half of the contract).
//!
//! # Quick example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use autumn_web::pdf::Pdf;
//! use autumn_web::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[get("/invoices/{id}/pdf")]
//! async fn invoice_pdf(id: Path<i64>) -> Pdf {
//!     let markup = html! {
//!         h1 { "Invoice #" (*id) }
//!         p { "Total: $42.00" }
//!     };
//!     Pdf::from_markup(markup).filename("invoice.pdf")
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Not a CSS layout engine
//!
//! This renders a **deliberately small HTML subset** — headings, paragraphs,
//! tables, lists, `<strong>`/`<em>` emphasis, `<br>`/`<hr>` — flowed
//! top-to-bottom in a single column with the built-in PDF base-14 fonts
//! (Helvetica). It does **not** parse CSS, does not lay out `<div>`s as boxes
//! with padding/borders/floats, and does not do pixel-perfect text metrics —
//! that is out of scope by design (see issue #1317's "Out of Scope" section).
//! Any tag this renderer doesn't specifically recognize (`<div>`, `<span>`,
//! `<a>`, widget-generated wrapper markup, ...) is treated as a transparent
//! container: its text content still renders, just without special styling —
//! so a typical scaffold view degrades gracefully instead of dropping
//! content or erroring. `<script>`, `<style>`, `<noscript>`, `<template>`,
//! `<head>`, and `<title>` are the exception — their content is never
//! rendered as visible text, matching how a browser treats them, so passing
//! a full server-rendered page (not just a purpose-built fragment) to
//! [`Pdf::from_html`](crate::pdf::Pdf::from_html) doesn't leak inline CSS/JS source into the PDF.
//!
//! Text outside the base-14 fonts' WinAnsi encoding (CJK, emoji, ...) is
//! rendered as `?` by the underlying PDF writer rather than corrupting the
//! output — a known limitation of avoiding embedded font files (see the
//! "Runtime dependencies" section below). A single table cell whose content
//! wraps to more than a full page of lines is clipped at the bottom margin
//! rather than spilling onto a second page — realistic scaffold tables
//! (invoice line items, a handful of columns) never approach this.
//!
//! # Nesting depth limit
//!
//! The layout walker stops at 512 levels of tag nesting. This is defense
//! against very deep HTML. Content past this depth does not render — the
//! one exception to the "degrades gracefully" promise above.
//!
//! When this happens, [`render`](crate::pdf::Pdf::render) still returns normal, valid
//! PDF bytes — it does not return an error. Each render that hits the cap
//! logs one `tracing::warn!` event at target `autumn::pdf`, so you can
//! detect truncation from your log pipeline.
//!
//! A typical scaffold view (headings, paragraphs, tables) stays far under
//! 512 levels. Recursive content — a comment thread, a nested reply tree —
//! can reach it.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Rendering the same HTML input always produces the same visible content:
//! [`extract_text`](crate::pdf::extract_text) (and the [`assert_pdf_contains`](crate::test::TestResponse::assert_pdf_contains)
//! test helper built on it) returns identical text for identical input, with
//! no wall-clock or other hidden state read during rendering — any
//! timestamp that should appear in the document (e.g. an invoice's "Generated
//! at" line) is the caller's responsibility to render into the HTML using
//! the injected [`Clock`](crate::time::Clock), not something this module
//! reads on its own.
//!
//! The **raw bytes** are not guaranteed to be identical between renders: the
//! underlying PDF writer ([`printpdf`]) assigns each document a random
//! trailer `/ID`, per the PDF spec's file-identification convention, and
//! that generator isn't exposed as configurable. Nothing else in the file
//! varies with identical input, but this rules out a byte-for-byte equality
//! assertion — text-content equality is the supported determinism contract.
//!
//! # Runtime dependencies
//!
//! Rendering uses [`printpdf`]'s core PDF writer with `default-features =
//! false` — no system-installed browser or renderer, and no embedded font
//! files: the base-14 fonts (Helvetica, Times, Courier, ...) are guaranteed
//! present in every PDF-compliant viewer, so nothing needs to ship inside
//! (or be downloaded by) your binary. This keeps PDF generation compatible
//! with the single-binary deployment story (issue #1004).
