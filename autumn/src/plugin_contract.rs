//! The versioned plugin API stability contract (issue #1601).
//!
//! Autumn's plugin system is a compile-time Rust surface: a plugin depends on
//! `autumn-web`, implements [`Plugin`](crate::plugin::Plugin), and is mounted
//! with [`AppBuilder::plugin`](crate::app::AppBuilder::plugin). That makes most
//! breakage a compiler error rather than a production incident — but only if
//! plugin authors know *which* APIs they may build on, and get told when the
//! framework they are mounted into is not the one they were written for.
//!
//! This module is the machine-readable half of that contract. It carries three
//! things:
//!
//! 1. [`PLUGIN_SURFACES`] — every plugin-facing API, declared [`Stable`] or
//!    [`Experimental`]. `docs/plugins.md` renders the same list, and
//!    `scripts/check-plugin-surface.sh` fails when the two disagree.
//! 2. [`PluginContract`] — what a plugin declares about *itself*: the
//!    `autumn-web` range it supports and any experimental surface it knowingly
//!    leans on. A plugin returns one from
//!    [`Plugin::contract`](crate::plugin::Plugin::contract).
//! 3. [`evaluate`] — the compatibility verdict, and the diagnostic an
//!    incompatible pairing produces.
//!
//! # The `SemVer` policy, by tier
//!
//! | Tier | Promise | What a break costs |
//! |------|---------|--------------------|
//! | [`SurfaceTier::Stable`] | Covered by `STABILITY.md`. Below `1.0` a break needs a minor bump, a migration guide, and a filled *Plugin authors* section in that guide; from `1.0` on it needs a major. | A build failure with an upgrade path. |
//! | [`SurfaceTier::Experimental`] | May change in **any** release, including a patch. Declare it with [`PluginContract::uses_experimental`] so `autumn plugin-check` can report it. | A build failure you opted into. |
//!
//! # Declaring a contract
