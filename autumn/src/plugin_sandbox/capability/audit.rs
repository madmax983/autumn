//! "What did this plugin do in the last hour?" (issue #1632).
//!
//! An operator who granted five capabilities to an artifact they did not audit
//! needs one place to answer that. Not five: a cache metric, an upstream's
//! access log, a job table and a `grep` of the application log is four places
//! and no answer, because none of them knows which plugin was responsible.
//!
//! So every capability call — allowed, denied or over quota — is recorded at the
//! one point that knows all of it — `CapabilityRuntime::record`, the single exit
//! every `dispatch` takes — and the records aggregate here:
//!
//! ```text
//!   request ──► CapabilityEvent × n ──► SandboxOutcome.activity
//!                                            │
//!                                            ▼
//!                                    PluginActivityLog  ──► ActivitySummary
//!                                    (bounded, windowed)     hosts called,
//!                                                            kv/db/job counts,
//!                                                            denials, quota hits
//! ```
//!
//! # What a record carries, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! A record names the capability, the operation, and the *logical* target — the
//! key, the table, the hostname, the job type. It never carries a value, a row,
//! a request body or a response. An audit surface that logged what a plugin
//! stored would be a second copy of the tenant data the capability system exists
//! to contain, in a place with different access rules — and an operator asking
//! "what did it do" is asking about shape, not contents.
