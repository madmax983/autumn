//! Per-request capability quotas (issue #1632).
//!
//! Fuel is the guest's ceiling. It is not the host's: a `kv-set` costs the guest
//! one call frame and costs the host a cache round-trip; a `job-enqueue` costs
//! it a durable write. A plugin whose fuel budget is generous — which every
//! plugin that renders a page has — could spend all of it on host work priced
//! at nothing.
//!
//! So every capability carries a count, and the counts share one budget:
//!
//! * a per-capability ceiling (`kv_reads`, `outbound_calls`, …) bounds one
//!   surface, and
//! * `calls` bounds the *sum*, so a plugin cannot spend every per-capability
//!   ceiling at once and call that staying within its quota.
//!
//! Exceeding one denies that call and records it. It does not fail the request:
//! see the module header on why a denial is an answer.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.
