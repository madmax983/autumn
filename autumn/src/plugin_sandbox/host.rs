//! The sandbox host: a `wasmi` interpreter plus a deny-by-default WASI shim.
//!
//! # The sandbox *is* this file's import list
//!
//! A WebAssembly guest can do exactly two things on its own: compute, and call
//! a function the host gave it. It has no syscalls, no ambient file
//! descriptors and no way to name anything outside its own linear memory. So
//! the entire authority a sandboxed plugin holds is the list of host functions
//! `define_wasi_shim` registers — which is why they are all in one function,
//! in one place, readable top to bottom.
//!
//! Every one of them either serves the request dialogue or says no:
//!
//! | Import | Behaviour |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `fd_read` (fd 0) | the next bytes of the request frame |
//! | `fd_write` (fd 1) | the response frame, one NDJSON line |
//! | `fd_write` (fd 2) | captured as diagnostics, surfaced in the failure detail |
//! | `random_get` | a fixed-seed PRNG — entropy is not authority, but it is not ambient either |
//! | `clock_time_get` | a fixed instant |
//! | `sched_yield`, `fd_close`, `fd_fdstat_get`, `fd_seek`, `fd_tell` | inert |
//! | `environ_*`, `args_*` | **empty, and each call recorded as a denial** |
//! | every `path_*`, every `fd_*` on an unknown descriptor | **`ENOTCAPABLE`/`EBADF`, recorded** |
//! | every `sock_*`, `poll_oneoff`, `proc_raise` | **`ENOTCAPABLE`, recorded** |
//! | `proc_exit` | ends the guest, never the host |
//!
//! There is no `path_open` that opens, no `fd_prestat_get` that resolves, and
//! no socket that connects. A capability is not "off by default" here — for
//! everything but request handling, there is no implementation to turn on.
//!
//! # The world is closed
//!
//! Anything the module imports that this shim does not define is refused at
//! **load**, before the artifact can run once, and the refusal names the
//! import. That is what makes a bespoke seam — `autumn_db::query`,
//! `env::system` — a non-starter rather than a runtime error a guest could
//! catch and retry.
//!
//! # Everything a guest does wrong is a value, never a process event
//!
//! A trap (what a Rust panic compiles to on wasm), a `proc_exit`, fuel
//! exhaustion, a refused allocation, a malformed frame, a guest that never
//! answers: all of them come back as [`SandboxFailure`] inside an
//! [`SandboxOutcome`]. Nothing in this module can abort, exit or panic the host
//! process.
