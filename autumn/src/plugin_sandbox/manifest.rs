//! The capability manifest that accompanies a sandboxed plugin artifact.
//!
//! The manifest is the *whole* review surface. An operator who reads it knows
//! everything the plugin may do, because the runtime refuses to do anything the
//! manifest does not name:
//!
//! ```toml
//! name = "autumn-plugin-hello"
//! version = "0.1.0"
//! wire_version = 1
//! prefix = "/hello"
//! capabilities = ["http-request"]
//! sha256 = "…64 hex chars, the module's digest…"
//!
//! [[routes]]
//! method = "GET"
//! path = "/hello/greet"
//!
//! [limits]
//! fuel = 200_000_000
//! memory_bytes = 33_554_432
//! ```
//!
//! # Everything here fails closed
//!
//! Parsing is not "read what you recognise and ignore the rest". An unknown
//! key, an unknown capability name, a future `wire_version`, a declared route
//! outside the declared prefix, a zero or oversized limit, a digest that is not
//! 64 lowercase hex characters — each is a hard error, because every one of
//! them is a case where the operator's reading of the manifest and the
//! runtime's would differ. A manifest an older build cannot fully understand is
//! a manifest it must refuse to run.
//!
//! # The routes are enforced, not documented
//!
//! [`SandboxManifest::routes`] is not advisory metadata. The host builds its
//! router from exactly these `(method, path)` pairs, so a request to an
//! undeclared path under the prefix is a 404 the guest never sees. That is what
//! makes "which routes it mounts" a property of the manifest rather than a
//! promise about the artifact.
