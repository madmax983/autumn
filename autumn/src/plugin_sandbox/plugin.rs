//! Mounting a sandboxed artifact as an ordinary Autumn [`Plugin`].
//!
//! A [`SandboxedPlugin`] is installed exactly like a native one:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::path::Path;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let plugin = autumn_web::plugin_sandbox::SandboxedPlugin::from_file(
//!     Path::new("plugins/hello.autumn-plugin"),
//! )?;
//! let app = autumn_web::app().plugin(plugin);
//! # let _ = app;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! …and from the application's point of view that is where the resemblance
//! ends. A native plugin's `build` receives the whole `AppBuilder`. This one
//! receives nothing: the mount is performed by the framework, from the
//! manifest, and consists of exactly one `nest` at the declared prefix plus the
//! declared route metadata.
//!
//! # The manifest is the mount
//!
//! The router is built from the manifest's `[[routes]]`, one axum route per
//! declared `(method, path)`. A request to an undeclared path under the prefix
//! is a 404 the guest never sees, and a request to a path *outside* the prefix
//! never reaches this router at all. So "which routes it mounts" is a property
//! the runtime enforces, not a claim the artifact makes.
//!
//! # What a misbehaving plugin costs
//!
//! | Its behaviour | What the caller gets | What the rest of the app gets |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | answers | its answer, minus any header it may not set | nothing |
//! | traps, exits, answers badly | 502 on its own prefix | nothing |
//! | spins or floods output | 504 on its own prefix | nothing |
//! | is already at its concurrency ceiling | 503 with `Retry-After` | nothing |
//! | is sent a body over its ceiling | 413, guest never started | nothing |
//!
//! The last column is the point. Every failure mode is scoped to the plugin's
//! own prefix, because the interpreter runs on a blocking worker with a bounded
//! permit count and can only ever return a value.
