//! The sandbox wire protocol (version 1).
//!
//! The host and the guest talk NDJSON over the guest's stdio: one JSON object
//! per line, `\n`-terminated, `op`-tagged. That is the entire ABI. It is
//! deliberately boring, so a plugin can be written in any language that can
//! target `wasm32-wasip1` — with no bindgen, no vendor SDK and no shared
//! header — and so an author debugging a plugin can read the traffic.
//!
//! ```text
//! host  → guest  {"op":"request","wire_version":1,"granted":["http-request"],
//!                 "method":"GET","route":"/hello/{id}","path":"/hello/7","query":"a=b",
//!                 "path_params":[["id","7"]],"headers":[["accept","text/html"]],"body_b64":""}
//! guest → host   {"op":"response","status":200,"headers":[["content-type","text/plain"]],"body_b64":"aGk="}
//! guest → host   {"op":"error","detail":"no handler for that route"}
//! ```
//!
//! The dialogue is strictly one frame in, one frame out. There is no seam the
//! guest can use to ask the host for anything, because in this slice the guest
//! is granted nothing to ask for.
//!
//! # What never crosses, in either direction
//!
//! Both directions are **allowlists**. Only [`ALLOWED_REQUEST_HEADERS`] reach
//! the guest: the sandbox grants no session, auth or credential capability, so
//! a cookie or a bearer token reaching a plugin could only ever be a liability
//! — and there is no finished list of what a credential is called, because
//! every authenticating proxy invents its own header for one.
//!
//! On the way back, only [`ALLOWED_RESPONSE_HEADERS`] survive, and only the
//! content types in [`ALLOWED_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPES`] are served at all. Both
//! are allowlists for the same reason: the sandbox's whole job is to withhold
//! the host application's origin, and a response is served *from* that origin.
//! A `Set-Cookie` forges a session in it, a `Strict-Transport-Security`
//! rewrites its TLS posture, and an `application/javascript` body executes in
//! it. A deny-list would have to name each of those and the next one nobody has
//! standardised yet.
//!
//! Header names and values are validated before they reach a response: a value
//! carrying `\r\n` would otherwise let a guest inject headers of its own into
//! the host's response, which is a `Set-Cookie` by another route.

/// while routing hands it to the application — the very confusion this exists
/// to prevent, restored one level down.
///
/// Answering "does the combined router send this to me?" needs the
/// application's routes, which a host built from an artifact alone does not
