//! Push subscription storage: the browser payload, its validated form, and
//! the pluggable [`PushSubscriptionStore`] backends.
//!
//! A browser hands the application a `PushSubscription` — an endpoint URL plus
//! two base64url keys — which the app must persist against whoever is signed
//! in. [`BrowserSubscription::decode`] is the validating boundary: it is the
//! single place a browser-supplied (and therefore attacker-influenceable)
//! payload is turned into a [`StoredSubscription`], so a row that reaches a
//! store is always one the send path can actually use.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! Resolution mirrors [`Notifications`](crate::notifications::Notifications):
//!
//! 1. A store registered via `AppBuilder::with_push_subscription_store(...)`.
//! 2. [`DbPushSubscriptionStore`] when a database pool is configured (the
//!    `push_subscriptions` table is scaffolded by `autumn generate pwa`).
//! 3. [`MemoryPushSubscriptionStore`] otherwise — process-local, for tests
//!    and DB-less development.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.

///   to what it buys, because —
/// - [`list_for`](PushSubscriptionStore::list_for) returns **at most** this
///   many rows. That is the bound that matters: it caps the work a single
///   notification can cause no matter how many rows a race, a restored backup,
///   or a hand-written `INSERT` managed to leave in the table.

/// So the row count is approximately capped and the *per-notification work* is

/// - **`endpoint` is the primary identity.** [`save`](Self::save) upserts on
///   it: re-saving an endpoint updates the existing row and never creates a
///   second one.
/// - **A cross-principal move requires proof of possession.** Re-saving an
///   endpoint that currently belongs to a *different* principal is allowed
///   only when the incoming `p256dh` **and** `auth` both match the stored ones;
///   otherwise it is
///   [`PushError::EndpointClaimed`]. This keeps the legitimate case working —
///   a shared device where a second user signs in re-subscribes and the
///   browser returns the *same* endpoint **and the same keys**, so the row
///   moves — while refusing the attack it otherwise enables: an endpoint URL
///   is only a capability to *send*, and without this rule anyone who obtained
///   one could re-register it under their own account with their own keys,
///   silently cutting the victim off and redirecting their notifications.
