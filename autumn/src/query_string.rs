//! Structured query-string decoding for [`Query<T>`](crate::extract::Query)
//! (issue #1972).
//!
//! See the [extractors guide](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/blob/trunk/docs/guide/extractors.md)
//! for the narrative version, with worked examples.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `Query<T>` used to delegate straight to
//! [`serde_urlencoded`](https://docs.rs/serde_urlencoded), which is **strictly
//! flat**: it decodes `?q=foo&page=2` and nothing else. A `Vec<String>` field
//! fed the repeated-key form `?tags=a&tags=b` failed with `invalid type: string
//! "a", expected a sequence`, and a nested struct field was unrepresentable by
//! any encoding. That left MCP tool contracts unhonorable — `tools/call`
//! dispatch renders an array query argument as repeated keys, so a tool whose
//! `inputSchema` advertised `tags: array` dispatched a request its own handler
//! rejected — and pushed builders onto comma-separated strings and
//! JSON-in-a-string fields.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! The decoder is a **superset** of the flat form: a query string with unique
//! scalar keys decodes exactly as it did before. On top of that it accepts a
//! bracketed dialect whose `items[0][sku]` shape matches the repeated-row
//! encoding [`nested_form`](crate::nested_form) renders — generalized here to
//! arbitrary objects, sequences and depths. Note this applies to the **query
//! string only**: [`Form<T>`](crate::form) and
//! [`NestedChangesetForm`](crate::nested_form::NestedChangesetForm) still decode
//! request *bodies* through `serde_urlencoded` and its own nested-row parser.
//!
//! ```text
//! q=foo                       // scalar
//! page=2                      // scalar, coerced to the field's type
//! tags=a&tags=b               // repeated key   → sequence ["a", "b"]
//! tags[]=a&tags[]=b           // append form    → sequence ["a", "b"]
//! tags[0]=a&tags[2]=c         // indexed form   → sequence ["a", "c"]
//! filter[status]=open         // nested object  → { status: "open" }
//! items[0][sku]=A-1           // array of objects
//! ```
//!
//! Percent-encoded brackets (`%5B` / `%5D`) are the same thing: keys are
//! percent-decoded before parsing, so a client that encodes them round-trips
//! identically.
//!
//! # Deliberate semantics
//!
//! * **Scalar coercion matches `serde_urlencoded`.** Values arrive as text and
//!   are parsed with [`str::parse`] into the field's type, so `page=2` fills a
//!   `u32` and `flag=true` fills a `bool`. An `Option<T>` field that is
//!   *present but empty* (`?page=`) still visits `Some`, exactly as
//!   `serde_urlencoded` does — only an **absent** key is `None`.
//! * **A duplicated key is an error in a single-valued position.** `?q=a&q=b`
//!   against a `String` field is rejected — `serde_urlencoded` + serde's derive
//!   rejected it too (`duplicate field`), and quietly picking one of two values
//!   is how parameter-pollution bugs are built. A **sequence** field takes every
//!   occurrence; that is the whole point of the repeated-key form.
//! * **Errors never echo a value.** A decode failure names the field path and
//!   the expected type, never the submitted text — the message is returned in
//!   the 400 body and recorded by error reporters, and a query parameter can
//!   hold a secret.
//! * **Shape conflicts poison one key, not the request.**
//!   `?filter=flat&filter[status]=open` uses one name as both a scalar and a
//!   container. That key is rejected *if the target claims it*; a target that
//!   ignores it (ad-tracking junk, a crawler's garbage parameter) still decodes,
//!   exactly as it did when the key was merely unrecognised.
//! * **Malformed brackets stay literal.** A key the bracket grammar cannot
//!   parse (`weird[unclosed`) is used verbatim as a flat key, so a stray
//!   bracket never turns into a parse failure.
//! * **Nesting is depth-capped** at [`MAX_DEPTH`] and indices key an ordered
//!   map rather than a `Vec`, so neither deep nesting nor a huge index
//!   (`tags[4000000000]=x`) lets a request drive unbounded allocation.
//!
//! * **Map iteration is key-ordered.** The tree keys each level with a
//!   `BTreeMap`, so a `Query<Vec<(String, String)>>` target sees pairs sorted
//!   by key rather than in submission order (occurrences of one key keep their
//!   order). Deterministic either way, but not the wire order.
//!
//! # Compatibility note
//!
//! Brackets are now *structure*, not part of the key text. A target that types
//! a parameter as a plain value — `Query<HashMap<String, String>>` is the
//! common one — used to receive `?filter[a]=1` as the literal key
//! `"filter[a]"`; it now sees a nested object and reports a decode error
//! naming the fix. Type such a field as a nested struct, or as
//! `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` to accept either shape.
