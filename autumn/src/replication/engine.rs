//! The replication loop: the in-process worker that ships `SQLite`'s WAL to an
//! offsite destination, continuously, while the app serves traffic (#1628).
//!
//! # The invariant everything else hangs off
//!
//! In WAL journal mode `SQLite` **never writes the main database file except
//! during a checkpoint**. Every committed page goes to the `-wal` sidecar until
//! someone checkpoints it back. So if exactly one component is allowed to
//! checkpoint, that component can also take a byte-faithful copy of the main
//! database file at any other moment and know it is a consistent base for the
//! WAL frames that follow it.
//!
//! That component is this one. Autumn's `SQLite` pool sets
//! `PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 0` when replication is enabled, and the
//! replicator holds one connection open for the process's lifetime — which also
//! stops `SQLite`'s *last connection closing* from checkpointing behind our back.
//!
//! # The tick
//!
//! ```text
//! read the -wal header
//!   no generation yet, or the salt changed unexpectedly, or the WAL shrank
//!       → open a new generation: copy + gzip the database file, upload it,
//!         then write snapshot.json as the commit marker
//! scan the frame chain from the last shipped commit
//!   → ship [shipped_offset, last commit boundary) as one segment
//! everything shipped, and the WAL is over its size budget
//!   → checkpoint(TRUNCATE), then either open the next WAL *index* inside this
//!     generation (cheap) or, once the generation is older than the snapshot
//!     interval, start a new generation with a fresh base snapshot
//! ```
//!
//! The index/generation split is what keeps this affordable. A checkpoint is
//! unavoidable — the `-wal` cannot grow without bound — but treating every
//! checkpoint as a new generation would re-upload the entire database each time
//! `max_wal_bytes` is reached, which on a busy database is gigabytes of write
//! amplification per hour. A checkpoint therefore costs one index bump; a full
//! base snapshot happens on the snapshot interval, which is also what bounds how
//! much WAL a restore has to replay.
//!
//! Two orderings carry the whole durability story:
//!
//! * a segment ends on a **commit boundary**, so a replica is never a
//!   half-transaction;
//! * a checkpoint is attempted **only when nothing is un-shipped**, so
//!   truncating the WAL can never discard bytes the destination has not
//!   acknowledged. A destination that is down therefore stalls checkpoints — the
//!   WAL grows, lag climbs, the health indicator goes `Down`, and data is kept.
//!   Disk is the thing that gets sacrificed, never durability.
