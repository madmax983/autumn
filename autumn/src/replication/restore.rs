//! Point-in-time restore from a replica (issue #1628, phase 2).
//!
//! Two halves, both pure of the transport:
//!
//! * [`plan`] reads only the destination's **key listing** — generation ids and
//!   segment names already carry their timestamps — and decides which generation
//!   and which prefix of its segments reconstruct the database as of a chosen
//!   instant. Nothing is downloaded to make that decision.
//! * [`apply`] downloads exactly that and rebuilds the database **index by
//!   index**: for each WAL index in the generation it reassembles a `db-wal`
//!   beside the snapshot, lets `SQLite`'s own recovery fold it in, and moves to
//!   the next — publishing the result only once the whole chain has replayed and
//!   the database passes its integrity check.
//!
//! # Refusal, not best effort
//!
//! Handing `SQLite` a damaged WAL is the dangerous failure mode: recovery stops at
//! the first frame that does not validate and reports success, so a silently
//! truncated replica looks like a clean restore that is merely missing the last
//! few minutes. Every check here therefore **refuses** rather than trims:
//!
//! * a generation without its `snapshot.json` commit marker is ignored (it was
//!   interrupted mid-upload);
//! * a missing or out-of-order segment sequence is an error, never a silent stop;
//! * a segment whose `start_offset` does not continue the previous one, or whose
//!   salt is not the generation's, is an error;
//! * every payload's SHA-256 and length are verified before use;
//! * the reassembled database must pass `PRAGMA integrity_check` **before** it is
//!   moved into place.
//!
//! The same code path backs the periodic verifier, so "verified restorable" means
//! literally that — a restore ran.
