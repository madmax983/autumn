//! Pluggable error reporting: capture handler panics and 5xx responses and
//! route them to one or more configured reporters.
//!
//! When an Autumn handler panics or returns a server error, the failure is
//! turned into a structured [`ErrorEvent`](crate::reporting::ErrorEvent) and
//! delivered to every registered
//! [`ErrorReporter`](crate::reporting::ErrorReporter). This is the "where do my
//! errors go?" seam: ship events to
//! Sentry, Honeycomb, Slack, or a custom sink by implementing a single trait
//! and wiring it once with
//! [`AppBuilder::with_error_reporter`](crate::app::AppBuilder::with_error_reporter).
//!
//! The design mirrors Rails' [Error Reporter] and Autumn's other pluggable
//! backends ([`BlobStore`](crate::storage::BlobStore),
//! [`Cache`](crate::cache::Cache)): a built-in
//! [`LogReporter`](crate::reporting::LogReporter) (which uses
//! `tracing`) ships as the default so the feature is useful with zero extra
//! dependencies, and one builder call swaps in your own sink.
//!
//! # What gets reported
//!
//! - **Handler panics.** A [`ReportingLayer`](crate::reporting::ReportingLayer)
//!   catches unwinding panics at the
//!   HTTP layer (so a single panicking handler can never abort the worker
//!   task), converts them into a sanitized [`AutumnError`](crate::AutumnError)
//!   `500` Problem Details response, and reports an
//!   [`ErrorEvent`](crate::reporting::ErrorEvent) carrying the
//!   panic payload and (when `RUST_BACKTRACE` is set) a backtrace.
//! - **Server errors.** Any response with a `5xx` status is reported with its
//!   status, message, and Problem Details type.
//!
//! Client (`4xx`) errors are intentionally *not* reported — this slice is
//! panics + server errors only.
//!
//! ## Scope: which 5xx are observed
//!
//! The layer is installed inner to
//! [`RequestIdLayer`](crate::middleware::RequestIdLayer) so every event carries
//! the request id (and a panic, which unwinds the inner stack, still has it).
//! A consequence of that placement is that 5xx responses produced by middleware
//! *outer* to it — most notably a `503` from the session layer when a session
//! store (e.g. Redis) is unavailable — are not observed here. That is a
//! deliberate trade-off: such failures are infrastructure outages already
//! surfaced by readiness/health probes, and moving reporting outside the
//! session layer would also move it outside `RequestIdLayer`, dropping the
//! request id from *every* event. Handler panics and handler/inner-middleware
//! server errors — the failures an app owner is expected to act on — are
//! reported with full context.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use autumn_web::reporting::{ErrorEvent, ErrorReporter, ReportFuture};
//!
//! struct SlackReporter {
//!     webhook_url: String,
//! }
//!
//! impl ErrorReporter for SlackReporter {
//!     fn report<'a>(&'a self, event: &'a ErrorEvent) -> ReportFuture<'a> {
//!         Box::pin(async move {
//!             // post `event` to Slack, swallow any transport error
//!             let _ = (&self.webhook_url, event.status);
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
