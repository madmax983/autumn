/// Apply the built-in inbound request timeout.

/// (the `prod` profile smart-defaults this to 30s) as a per-request wall-clock
/// deadline, with per-route overrides resolved from `route_timeouts` via the
/// matched route template. On expiry the handler returns a framework-standard
/// `503 Service Unavailable` (Problem Details JSON for API clients, the error
/// page for browsers — never a raw tower `BoxError`).
///
/// Streaming responses are exempt by construction: the deadline bounds the time
/// to produce the response head, not the duration of body streaming, so SSE and
/// chunked responses are never interrupted once the head is sent. Long-poll
/// handlers, which block *before* returning the head, are bound by the deadline
/// and must opt out via `timeout = "off"`. WebSocket routes inherit the deadline
/// ([`RouteTimeout::Inherit`](crate::route::RouteTimeout), emitted by `#[ws]`),
/// so it bounds a hung pre-upgrade handshake but never the established socket —
/// that future runs on a separate task via `on_upgrade` and is unbounded by
/// design.
///
/// The layer is a no-op (zero overhead) when the global timeout is disabled and
/// no route declares an `Override`.
///
/// `mirror_cors` makes a synthesized 503 carry the CORS response headers a
/// normal response would. Set it for the main ingress stack, where this layer
/// sits *outside* `CorsLayer` (see the order in `apply_middleware`) so the 503
/// never flows back through it; leave it off for the `/mcp` envelope, whose
/// timeout is applied *inner* to its `CorsLayer` and whose 503 is therefore
/// already CORS-readable.

/// layers) composed into a SINGLE `tower::Layer`, so an arbitrary number of
/// registrations costs one application instead of one per registration.
///
/// # Why this type exists
///
/// A `tower-layer` tuple needs every member's type at compile time; a `Vec` of
/// registrations does not have that. Erasing each registration to
/// [`ErasedAppLayer`](crate::app::ErasedAppLayer) at registration time makes
/// them homogeneous, and this type folds the homogeneous run by hand. The
/// result is one `Layer` that can sit inside `apply_middleware`'s single merged
/// tuple, so operator layers no longer deepen the framework's per-request
/// clone cascade (#2198) — the framework's overhead becomes a constant instead
/// of a function of how many layers an operator or plugin attached.
///
/// The fold costs exactly one boxing adapter for the whole run (the
/// `ErasedAppService::new` seed), regardless of how many layers it contains.
/// That box does NOT clone on call — `BoxCloneSyncService::call` forwards to
/// the inner service — so it adds no traversal to the cascade either; its
/// runtime cost is one `Box::pin` per request.
///
/// # Why an EMPTY run is still composed in `apply_middleware`
///
/// It is not dead weight there: it is the type boundary that makes the single
/// merged application compile in reasonable time. `tower::util::option_layer`
/// yields `Either<L::Service, S>`, in which the inner service type `S` appears
/// TWICE — so a chain of *n* conditional layers with no erasure between them
/// expands to a type of size `O(2ⁿ)`, and rustc proves `Router::layer`'s
/// `Send`/`Sync`/`Clone` obligations over that expansion. The ingress stack has
/// twelve `option_layer`s. Split at this slot they are 5 above and 7 below
/// (`2⁵ + 2⁷`); merged into one un-erased chain they are `2¹²`, which took
/// rustc over twenty minutes to check `apply_middleware` alone. Dropping this
/// boundary "to save a box when no layer is registered" brings that back.
///
/// `apply_layers_in_registration_order` (the SSG/ISG path) does the opposite
/// and skips an empty run: there the run is applied on its own `Router::layer`
/// call, so there is no long chain to break and the box would buy nothing.

    // `BoxCloneSyncService::new(..)`. N sequential `.layer()` calls build N
    // nested boxes, and `Route::call` deep-clones everything beneath it, so a
    // request descending N levels pays `N + (N-1) + … + 1` heap allocations.
    // Measured against axum 0.8.9 the fit is `13 + N(N+1)/2 + 2N` per request
    // (263 at N = 20, 1388 at N = 50); the same layers in ONE `Router::layer`
    // call cost a flat 16 for any N. See #2193.
    //
    // The layers below are therefore composed into tuples and applied in one
    // call instead of ~16 (#2198 collapsed the last four: the inner group, the
    // user layers, the middle group, and the session). `tower-layer` implements
    // `Layer` for tuples with the FIRST element outermost, so each tuple reads
    // top-to-bottom in ingress order.
    //
    // ⚠ This is the OPPOSITE of repeated `Router::layer` calls, where the LAST
    // call ends up outermost. Reverse the order when moving a layer between the
    // two forms. `tower::ServiceBuilder` matches the tuple form — first-added is
    // outermost — which is why `ComposedRegisteredLayers` folds its run in
    // reverse. Getting this backwards still compiles and type-checks; only
    // behavioural tests catch it.
