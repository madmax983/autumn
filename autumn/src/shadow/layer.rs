//! The traffic-mirroring tower layer (issue #1653).
//!
//! # The one invariant
//!
//! **The live request must not be able to tell that mirroring is on.** Every
//! design decision here follows from that:
//!
//! - The shadow request is dispatched on a **detached task** before the primary
//!   handler has even finished, so the two run concurrently and the client
//!   never waits on the candidate.
//! - The primary response body is **teed, not buffered**: frames flow to the
//!   client the instant they are produced and a copy accumulates on the side.
//!   Buffering-then-forwarding would have added the handler's whole body
//!   latency to every mirrored request.
//! - The shadow response is read into [`ResponseFacts`] inside the detached
//!   task and dropped there. It is never a `Response`, so no code path exists
//!   on which it could be returned.
//! - Every failure mode of the mirror (transport error, deadline, oversize
//!   body, a full in-flight ceiling) resolves to *a counter and nothing else*.
//!
//! # What bounds it
//!
//! `max_in_flight` reserves a slot before dispatch and releases it when the
//! detached task ends, so a candidate that stops answering costs at most that
//! many outstanding requests rather than one per inbound request. `timeout`
//! bounds each attempt. `max_body_bytes` bounds what either side may buffer —
//! an oversize body is not partially captured, it is abandoned and counted, so
//! a streaming endpoint cannot grow the process.
