//! In-memory shadow-run bookkeeping: counters plus a bounded ring of the most
//! recent divergences (issue #1653).
//!
//! Modelled on [`crate::actuator::TaskRegistry`] — a cheaply cloneable handle
//! over shared state that the actuator reads and the request path writes. Two
//! properties matter more here than they do for tasks:
//!
//! - **Bounded.** A mirror run against a badly-regressed candidate diverges on
//!   *every* request. The counters are unbounded (they saturate rather than
//!   wrap), but the stored records are capped at `max_records` and identical
//!   divergences collapse onto one record by
//!   [`fingerprint`](crate::shadow::diff::Divergence::fingerprint) — so a
//!   thousand copies of one regression occupy one slot, and the ring keeps
//!   showing distinct problems rather than a thousand copies of the loudest.
//! - **Clock-free.** The observation time is a parameter, never read from a
//!   clock in here, so the whole recording path stays a pure function of its
//!   inputs and a captured request replays to a byte-identical record.

// autumn-panic-gate: request-path module — production code path must be panic-free.
