//! Which requests get mirrored, and why the rest do not (issue #1653).
//!
//! The decision is a pure function of the request and one `roll` in `[0, 1)`
//! supplied by the caller, so it is fully testable and — when the roll comes
//! from a [`crate::entropy::SeededEntropy`], as it does under
//! [`#[sim_test]`](crate::sim_test) — reproducible.
//!
//! Six gates run before the sample rate is even consulted, cheapest first:
//!
//! 1. **Method.** Only [`MIRRORABLE_METHODS`] (`GET`/`HEAD`). This slice
//!    mirrors idempotent traffic only, and the set is a constant rather than a
//!    config key precisely so it cannot be widened by accident.
//! 2. **Loop guard.** A request already carrying [`SHADOW_HEADER`] is itself a
//!    mirrored request. Mirroring it again — which is what happens the moment
//!    someone points a shadow target at the app itself, or chains two shadows —
//!    would multiply traffic without bound.
//! 3. **Request body.** A request that carries a body (issue #2332) is
//!    never mirrored — whether the body is declared by the headers or
//!    undeclared (frames with no `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding`,
//!    reachable on HTTP/2). The mirror replays method, target, and headers
//!    but no body, so mirroring one would ask the candidate a *different*
//!    request than the live build answered and record the manufactured
//!    difference as a divergence. Until the mutating-traffic follow-up
//!    brings real request-body replay, these requests sit out quietly.
//! 4. **Conditional requests.** A `GET`/`HEAD` carrying `If-None-Match`,
//!    `If-Modified-Since`, `If-Range` (or `If-Match`/`If-Unmodified-Since`)
//!    is a cache revalidation, and a validator is scoped to the build that
//!    issued it. Replaying the primary's validator to the candidate makes the
//!    two builds answer differently for reasons that have nothing to do with a
//!    regression — the primary returns `304` while the candidate, whose
//!    validator differs, returns `200` — and when both *do* revalidate, the
//!    differ compares two empty `304` bodies and records a vacuous `match`
//!    that masks a genuine body regression. Conditional traffic is never
//!    mirrored (issue #2335); the skip is counted separately so the report
//!    shows how much coverage this costs on cache-heavy routes.
//! 5. **Exempt paths.** The actuator prefix and the platform probe paths. A
//!    load balancer's health checks are the highest-rate, least-interesting
//!    traffic an app serves; mirroring them buys nothing and drowns the
//!    candidate.
//! 6. **Route allowlist.** Empty means "every eligible route".
