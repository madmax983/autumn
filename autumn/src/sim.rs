//! Deterministic simulation testing (sim-testing, issue #1797).
//!
//! This module is the public 0.7.0 developer-experience surface for writing
//! **deterministic** simulation tests: a single [`#[sim_test]`](crate::sim_test)
//! attribute gives you a seeded [`Sim`] handle and a paused runtime, so a test
//! runs identically on every machine and every run, and a failure prints a
//! copy-pasteable line that reproduces it exactly.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use autumn_web::sim::Sim;
//! use autumn_web::sim_test;
//!
//! #[sim_test]
//! async fn deterministic(mut sim: Sim) {
//!     // The seed comes from `AUTUMN_SIM_SEED` (hex `0x..` or decimal,
//!     // default 0). Everything derived from `sim` is seed-driven and
//!     // reproducible.
//!     assert_eq!(sim.seed, 0);
//!     let _rng = sim.rng();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Reproduce a failing run by copying the replay line printed on panic, e.g.:
//!
//! ```text
//! AUTUMN_SIM_SEED=0x9f3a cargo test -p my-crate deterministic
//! ```
//!
//! # What a `Sim` gives you
//!
//! - **Virtual time.** [`Sim::build`] mounts a [`crate::test::TestApp`] with a
//!   virtual clock. [`Sim::advance`] and [`Sim::advance_to`] step it together
//!   with tokio's paused timer, so `#[job]` backoff and `#[scheduled]` ticks fire
//!   in virtual time. [`Sim::run_to_idle`] drains jobs, due ticks and durable
//!   commit hooks.
//! - **Seeded identity.** [`Sim::rng`] ([`SimRng`]) draws deterministic values.
//!   [`Sim::build`] seeds the app's [`crate::entropy::Entropy`] from the seed,
//!   so framework-minted ids (jobs, request ids, idempotency keys, sessions)
//!   replay too. [`Sim::seeded_entropy`] returns the same source.
//! - **Faults.** [`Chaos`] ([`Sim::chaos`]) injects seed-sampled faults.
//!   [`FaultPlan`] (#1680), attached with
//!   [`crate::test::TestApp::with_fault_plan`], injects authored ones and
//!   records a serializable [`FaultOutcome`]. [`Sim::kill`] and
//!   [`Sim::restart`] model a process crash; `sim::llm` is a seeded LLM stub.
//! - **Assertions and sweeps.** [`always!`](crate::always) and
//!   [`sometimes!`](crate::sometimes) ([`mod@assert`]). Behind the
//!   `sim-testing` feature, `sim::op` generates workloads (`Sim::gen_ops`,
//!   `Sim::run_proptest` with shrinking) and `sim::sweep` runs one scenario
//!   across many seeds (`sweep_proptest`, driven in CI by the `sim-sweep` bin).
//! - **Deadlocks.** With `AUTUMN_SIM_LIVENESS_BUDGET_SECS` set, a `#[sim_test]`
//!   whose tasks all park panics with its replay line instead of hanging. See
//!   [`__with_liveness_budget`] for the limits.
//! - **Phase 2 (issue #2967).** `Sim::net` routes outbound HTTP through a
//!   seeded `SimNet`. [`Sim::interleave`] and [`Sim::spawn`] reorder ready work
//!   from the seed. [`crash_at`] drops an operation at any await.
//!   [`Sim::try_run_to_idle`] reports a drain that does not settle. Framework
//!   code with no clock in scope reads [`crate::time::ambient_now`] and its
//!   siblings, which follow the sim clock.
//!
//! The clock and app handles inside a `Sim` are crate-private:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use autumn_web::sim::SimClock;
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use autumn_web::sim::SimApp;
//! ```
//!
//! Everything here is designed to grow additively (builder-style) without
//! breaking the frozen surface — hence the `#[non_exhaustive]` markers.

// Several thin accessors here could be `const fn`; they stay non-const so the
// frozen public surface can grow a non-const body later without a break.
