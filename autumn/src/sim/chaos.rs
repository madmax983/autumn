//! Deterministic fault injection for simulation tests (sim-testing W5, issue
//! #1797).
//!
//! This is the **chaos lane** of the sim harness: a small, additive, builder
//! that turns on reproducible faults — transient database checkout failures,
//! at-least-once job duplicate delivery, and wall-clock skew — so a
//! [`#[sim_test]`](crate::sim_test) can prove its code is idempotent and
//! resilient *without* a flaky, timing-dependent fault source.
//!
//! # The determinism contract
//!
//! Every fault decision is drawn from a **dedicated seeded entropy stream**,
//! independent of the app-facing [`SimRng`](crate::sim::SimRng) /
//! [`Entropy`] source an app is seeded with. The stream
//! is seeded from `seed ^ CHAOS_STREAM_SALT`, so:
//!
//! * chaos draws never perturb (and are never perturbed by) the application's
//!   own identifier stream, and
//! * the **same seed and the same chaos configuration replay the same fault
//!   schedule byte-for-byte** — under the paused, single-threaded sim runtime
//!   the hooks fire in a deterministic order (checkout #N, job #N), each drawing
//!   exactly one `u64` from the single `Mutex`-guarded stream.
//!
//! Every decision is recorded into a shared event log readable through
//! [`Sim::__chaos_events`](crate::sim::Sim::__chaos_events), which is what the W5
//! Definition-of-Done test asserts equality on across two same-seed runs.
//!
//! # Zero overhead when unused
//!
//! A default (empty) [`Chaos`] is **inactive**: [`Sim::build`](crate::sim::Sim::build)
//! installs nothing and is byte-for-byte unchanged, so every existing sim test
//! is unaffected. Chaos is opt-in via
//! [`Sim::chaos`](crate::sim::Sim::chaos).
//!
//! # See also: naming a fault instead of drawing one
//!
//! `Chaos` authors a *rate*. When a test needs to name the exact effect that
//! must fail — "the 3rd checkout", "the 2nd `send_invoice` execution" — and
//! freeze it as a regression test, use the authored lane,
//! [`FaultPlan`](crate::sim::FaultPlan) (issue #1680), which composes with an
//! active `Chaos` rather than replacing it.
//!
//! # Scope (W5.0)
//!
//! This wave ships the scaffolding and the three base fault kinds. Richer
//! per-fault surfaces (item 5/6/7 in the W5 stack) build additively on top of
//! this state and event log.

// The builder methods intentionally take `self` by value and clamp with runtime
// float ops, so they are not `const`-eligible; this narrowly-scoped allow keeps
// the module clean under the workspace's `nursery` lint set (matching the parent
// `sim` module's own allow) without masking real issues.
