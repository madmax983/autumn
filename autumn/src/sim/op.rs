//! Property-based `Op` generation and shrinking (sim-testing W6 PR2, issue
//! #1797).
//!
//! This is the **op-driver** lane of the sim harness: turning a seeded [`Sim`]
//! into a source of arbitrary, reproducible operation sequences, and — when a
//! sequence uncovers an [`always!`](crate::always) violation — shrinking that
//! sequence down to a minimal reproduction.
//!
//! # Design (rulings taken 2026-08-01, issue #1797 comment thread)
//!
//! Three shape questions were open before this could be written faithfully.
//! This module answers all three; see the issue thread for the full reasoning,
//! summarized here:
//!
//! 1. **Generic, not a shipped concrete `Op`.** [`Sim::gen_ops`] is
//!    `fn gen_ops<T: Arbitrary>(&mut self) -> Vec<T>` — the app supplies its own
//!    operation enum and `Arbitrary`/`Strategy` impl. A frozen, domain-agnostic
//!    [`Sim`] cannot ship a fixed operation vocabulary (the RFC's own worked
//!    examples, `Deposit`/`Transfer`, are app-domain, not framework-domain).
//!    (Named `gen_ops`, not the ruling's proposed `gen` — `gen` became a
//!    reserved keyword under the 2024 edition this workspace builds on, so it
//!    is not available as a method identifier without an ugly `r#gen` raw-ident
//!    call site.)
//! 2. **A runner-owning shrink entrypoint, `gen_ops()` redefined as
//!    generation-only.** [`Sim::gen_ops`] / [`Sim::gen_ops_with`] draw exactly one
//!    `Vec<T>` — they cannot shrink, because shrinking requires proptest to
//!    observe a case's pass/fail and rebuild state before the next try.
//!    [`Sim::run_proptest`] is the shrink-capable entrypoint: it owns a
//!    proptest `TestRunner`, and for every case (including every shrink
//!    attempt) rebuilds a **fresh** `Sim` from the same base seed before
//!    invoking the case closure — mirroring [`#[sim_test]`](crate::sim_test)'s
//!    "exactly one `Sim` per run" contract at the per-case level instead of the
//!    per-test level. This is additive: `#[sim_test]` and `Sim::build` are
//!    untouched.
//! 3. **`proptest` promoted to an optional *library* dependency** behind the
//!    new `sim-testing` feature (see `autumn/Cargo.toml`), since this module
//!    lives in `src/`, not `tests/`, and the `sim-sweep` `[[bin]]` ([`sim::sweep`](super::sweep),
//!    W6 PR3) needs it as a lib dep too — a `[[bin]]` cannot use dev-deps.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Both [`Sim::gen_ops`]/[`Sim::gen_ops_with`] and [`Sim::run_proptest`] seed proptest's
//! own case-generation RNG from a **dedicated stream**, `seed ^
//! OP_GEN_STREAM_SALT` — independent of the app-facing entropy source
//! ([`Sim::seeded_entropy`]), the [`chaos`](crate::sim::chaos) decision stream,
//! and the [`crash`](crate::sim::crash) decision stream (each salted
//! separately, so none of these streams perturb each other). Same seed ⇒ same
//! generated op sequence ⇒ same shrink path, byte-for-byte.
//!
//! Both also disable proptest's own file-based failure persistence
//! (`proptest-regressions/*.txt`) — the sim harness's `AUTUMN_SIM_SEED=…`
//! replay line is the single source of truth for reproducing a failure, so a
//! second, proptest-owned persistence file would just be a redundant (and
//! potentially stale) source of truth — and force off proptest's fork mode
//! and fork timeout regardless of any ambient `PROPTEST_FORK` /
//! `PROPTEST_TIMEOUT` env vars: both runners are owned in-process (there's no
//! `test_name` to hand proptest's forking machinery), so inheriting fork mode
//! would panic instead of generating ops.
//!
//! # Calling `body` closures that mount an app
//!
//! [`Sim::run_proptest`] itself neither builds nor enters a Tokio runtime — it
//! calls `body` directly, on whatever thread and in whatever ambient context
//! the caller invoked it from (this predates the op-driver; it was already
//! true of every earlier `Sim` entrypoint). A `body` that mounts a real app
//! via [`Sim::build`] therefore needs the **caller** to already have an
//! entered Tokio runtime — [`Sim::build`] starts the local job runtime
//! through a bare `tokio::spawn` (`job.rs`) when the app configures jobs,
//! which panics with `"there is no reactor running"` outside one. Call
//! [`Sim::run_proptest`] synchronously from inside an already-running async
//! context (e.g. a `#[tokio::test]` function, or code already inside
//! `Runtime::block_on`) rather than from a bare `fn main()` or a plain,
//! non-async `#[test]`.
//!
//! Even with a runtime entered, `body: Fn(&mut Sim, &[T])` is plain
//! synchronous — it can never itself `.await` [`Sim::advance`] /
//! [`Sim::run_to_idle`] to drain a mounted app's background job workers
//! mid-body, so job-backed invariants are better proven with
//! [`#[sim_test]`](crate::sim_test) (whose body is `async` and can drive
//! `run_to_idle` directly) than with the op-driver until a future async-body
//! variant of `run_proptest` exists.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use autumn_web::sim::Sim;
//! use proptest::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, proptest_derive::Arbitrary)]
//! enum Op {
//!     Deposit(u32),
//!     Transfer { to: u8, amount: u32 },
//! }
//!
//! // Called from inside a `#[tokio::test]` (or otherwise already inside a
//! // running Tokio runtime) — see "Calling `body` closures that mount an
//! // app" above for why that's required here.
//! let result = Sim::run_proptest(0, proptest::collection::vec(any::<Op>(), 1..32), |sim, ops| {
//!     sim.build(app());
//!     for op in ops {
//!         apply(sim, op);
//!     }
//!     always!(invariant_holds(sim));
//! });
//! assert!(result.is_ok(), "{}", result.unwrap_err());
//! ```
