//! Shared application state.
//!
//! This module defines [`AppState`], the core state object passed to all
//! Axum route handlers. It contains framework-managed resources like the
//! database connection pool, metrics collector, and WebSocket channels.
//!
//! Handlers typically don't extract `AppState` directly. Instead, they use
//! specialized extractors like [`Db`](crate::Db) which pull what they need
//! from the state. However, custom extractors can access the state via
//! `crate::extract::State<AppState>`.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Justify exceptions with
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")] at the narrowest scope.
