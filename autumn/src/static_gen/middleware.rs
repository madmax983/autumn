/// `#[static_get("/theme.css")] async fn theme() -> String`, but the
/// regeneration response still declares the raw `text/plain; charset=utf-8`
/// — comparing raw would refuse every refresh of such a route, so both sides
/// go through the same function and the guard compares what each side means.
///
/// The exact-match rule keeps this about *inferred* defaults only: only
/// axum's own two spellings are treated as generic. A handler that deliberately
/// declares one of these types on an extensioned route expresses it distinctly
/// — bare `text/plain`, or `application/octet-stream` with a parameter — and
/// that declaration is never screened.
///
/// # The one ambiguity
///
/// axum builds `String`'s response as
/// `([(CONTENT_TYPE, "text/plain; charset=utf-8")], body)`, which is
/// *byte-for-byte* the response a handler writing that tuple by hand produces.
/// There is no provenance to read: at this layer "inferred default" and
/// "deliberate declaration of the same type" are indistinguishable. So a route
/// with a recognized extension that deliberately declares one of these two
/// types — `/logo.png` declaring `application/octet-stream` to force a
/// download — is treated as the inferred case and screened to `image/png`.
///
/// The direction is chosen on which mistake is worse. Serving a stylesheet or
/// a script as `text/plain` is *silently fatal* under `nosniff` (the browser
/// drops it, with no console error about the type), and writing `-> String`
/// is the obvious way to author such a route. Serving a deliberately
/// octet-stream `.png` as `image/png` is visible and mild — and forcing a
/// download is properly expressed with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, which
/// this does not touch.
