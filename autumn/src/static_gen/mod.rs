//! Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
//!
//! Sometimes, rendering a page on every request is just too slow. For pages where the
//! data changes rarely (like a blog post or a marketing landing page), it is much faster
//! to generate the HTML once at build time.
//!
//! This module provides the engine to pre-render routes annotated with `#[static_get]`
//! and serve them lightning-fast via the [`crate::static_gen::StaticFileLayer`].
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! 1. **Build phase:** `autumn build` discovers your `#[static_get]` routes and runs them, saving the HTML to `dist/`.
//! 2. **Runtime phase:** The `StaticFileLayer` intercepts requests. If a pre-rendered file exists, it serves it directly!
//!
//! ## Build-time-only vs runtime ISR: choosing the right model
//!
//! ### Build-time-only (`revalidate = None`)
//!
//! Pages are rendered once during `autumn build` and served read-only at
//! runtime. `dist/` can be baked into a container image or uploaded to a
//! CDN -- no process needs write access at runtime.
//!
//! **When to use:** marketing pages, blog posts, documentation -- any page
//! where staleness of a full redeploy cycle is acceptable.
//!
//! ### Runtime ISR (`#[static_get(..., revalidate = N)]`)
//!
//! Pages are pre-rendered at build time **and** refreshed in the background
//! when they become stale (stale-while-revalidate). The serving process
//! needs write access to `dist/` at runtime.
//!
//! **When to use:** product listings, leaderboards, dashboards -- pages
//! that should stay fresh without a full redeploy but don't need to be
//! up-to-the-second accurate.
//!
//! #### Multi-replica ISR
//!
//! In single-replica / development deployments the default
//! [LocalIsrCoordinator] is sufficient: an AtomicBool
//! per route prevents duplicate background tasks within the same process.
//!
//! In **multi-replica** deployments sharing a writable `dist/` volume or
//! object-backed storage, each replica independently detects staleness and
//! can race to regenerate the same page. Supply a
//! [PostgresIsrCoordinator] (feature db) via
//! [StaticFileLayer::with_isr_coordinator] so that only one replica wins
//! the lock per revalidation window:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use autumn_web::static_gen::{StaticFileLayer, PostgresIsrCoordinator};
//!
//! let layer = StaticFileLayer::new("dist")
//!     .unwrap()
//!     .with_router(app_router.clone())
//!     .with_isr_coordinator(Arc::new(PostgresIsrCoordinator::new(db_pool)));
//! ```
//!
//! See [isr_coordinator] for the full deployment contract table.
