/// the app's global middleware) and on a bare `axum::Router` in tests.

/// one shared [`SyncScope::GLOBAL`] scope — appropriate for single-user or
/// local deployments where every authenticated device deliberately sees
/// the same data set. When auth middleware DOES insert a `SyncScope`
/// extension, it is honored. **Multi-user deployments must use
/// [`scoped_router`]** (which fails closed when the extension is missing)
/// and derive the scope from the authenticated principal, or every user
/// silently shares the global partition.
///
/// Request bounds and validation: push batches larger than
/// [`MAX_PUSH_CHANGES`](crate::sync::protocol::MAX_PUSH_CHANGES) changes
/// are rejected with `413` (request bodies are additionally capped by
/// axum's default body limit), batches containing an upsert without a
/// payload — or a `change_id` repeated within the batch — are rejected
/// with `422` (nothing applied — see
