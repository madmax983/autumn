//! Per-tenant in-process memory accounting cells.
//!
//! A [`TenantCell`] gives each resolved tenant its own byte-accounting boundary
//! with a soft memory quota and an owned scratch buffer. Allocations that flow
//! through the cell's API are tracked; when the cell is evicted and dropped,
//! Rust's ownership rules deterministically reclaim its tracked footprint.
//!
//! The guarantee is scoped to *tracked* bytes — allocations made through the
//! cell's API — not a tenant's true process resident set size. Work a handler
//! performs outside the cell (e.g. a bare `Box::new`) is invisible to the
//! counter by design.
//!
//! # Accounting model
//!
//! [`TenantCell::tracked_bytes`] is a deterministic accounting of the
//! allocations made *through* the cell, and covers exactly three things: (a)
//! each live [`Charge`]'s declared bytes, (b) the allocation *capacity* of every
//! stored scratch key `String` and value `Vec<u8>`, and (c) a fixed
//! [`SCRATCH_ENTRY_OVERHEAD`](TenantCell::scratch_entry_overhead) per scratch
//! entry (covering the map's per-entry
//! `String`/`Vec` headers and an amortized bucket slot, so the *count* of tiny
//! entries is bounded against the quota). This per-entry overhead is charged
//! against a **high-water mark** of the live scratch-entry count rather than the
//! instantaneous count: it is *not* released when an individual entry is removed
//! — [`HashMap`] does not shrink its bucket array on `remove`, so the enlarged
//! bucket allocation stays resident — and it is reclaimed only when the whole
//! cell is dropped/evicted (which drops the map, freeing the buckets).
//! Re-inserting keys within a prior peak therefore adds no new overhead. It is
//! explicitly **not** a measurement of the tenant's true process RSS:
//! allocator-internal fragmentation, size-class rounding, and any allocation a
//! handler makes outside the cell's API are out of scope by design. This is a
//! safe-Rust accounting cell, not a bounding allocator.
