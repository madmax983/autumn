///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// [`ClockSource`] models only `DateTime<Utc>`, so framework code that needed a
/// duration (request latency, query timings, task run times, uptime) reached
/// for [`std::time::Instant`] directly — off the injected seam. `Instant` is
/// opaque and cannot be constructed at an arbitrary point, and tokio's
/// `start_paused` test runtime does **not** virtualize it (only
/// [`tokio::time::Instant`] moves with the paused timer). Under a
/// [`#[sim_test]`](crate::sim_test) those measurements silently came from the
/// real machine clock: a 24-hour virtual advance read back as microseconds, and
/// two runs of the same seed disagreed.
///
/// `MonotonicInstant` is an offset from its source's own origin, so a virtual
/// clock can produce one at any point while a real clock keeps genuine
/// monotonicity.
///
/// # Guarantees
///
/// - **Monotonic in production.** [`SystemClock`] derives it from a
///   process-global [`std::time::Instant`], so a wall-clock/NTP jump — even a
///   backwards one — can never make an elapsed duration negative or absurd.
///   Comparing wall-clock timestamps has no such guarantee.
/// - **Virtual under simulation.** [`TickingClock`] derives it from the virtual
///   instant, so [`Sim::advance`](crate::sim::Sim::advance) moves it and the same
///   seed replays the same durations byte-for-byte.
/// - **Only comparable within one source.** Two `MonotonicInstant`s are relative
///   to their own clock's origin; subtracting across different clocks is
///   meaningless. [`saturating_duration_since`](Self::saturating_duration_since)
///   never panics and never underflows.
///
/// # Taking two readings
///
/// Measuring elapsed time needs a *start* and an *end*. The [`Clock`] extractor
/// is a **snapshot** taken when the extractor resolved, so
/// [`Clock::monotonic`] gives you the request-start instant and never moves —
/// calling it twice returns the same value. Take the closing reading from the
