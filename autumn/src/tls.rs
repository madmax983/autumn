//! Inbound (server-side) TLS support (issue #1603).
//!
//! This module lets an Autumn app terminate HTTPS in-process, without a
//! sidecar reverse proxy, when `[server.tls]` names a certificate + key.
//! It provides five things:
//!
//! (`lib.rs` carries an outer doc comment on `pub mod tls`, which is merged
//! with this block, so every link below is fully qualified — a bare item name
//! would resolve in the crate root instead of here.)
//!
//! 1. **Fail-fast loading** — [`load_certified_key`](crate::tls::load_certified_key)
//!    reads the PEM cert chain and private key from disk, verifies they parse
//!    and that the private key matches the leaf certificate (rustls'
//!    [`CertifiedKey::from_der`](rustls::sign::CertifiedKey::from_der) compares
//!    `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`), and rejects an already-expired leaf certificate.
//!    Every error names the offending path so a misconfiguration is actionable.
//! 2. **A reloadable resolver** —
//!    [`ReloadableCertResolver`](crate::tls::ReloadableCertResolver) holds the
//!    current [`CertifiedKey`](rustls::sign::CertifiedKey) behind an `RwLock`
//!    and implements [`ResolvesServerCert`](rustls::server::ResolvesServerCert),
//!    so the certificate can be swapped atomically at runtime (e.g. after an
//!    ACME/`certbot` renewal) without dropping the listener or restarting the
//!    process.
//! 3. **Expiry inspection** — [`inspect_leaf`](crate::tls::inspect_leaf)
//!    returns the leaf certificate's `notAfter` so `autumn doctor` can warn on
//!    near-expiry and fail on an expired certificate, offline (no server boot,
//!    no network).
//! 4. **The listener** — [`TlsListener`](crate::tls::TlsListener) is the
//!    `axum::serve::Listener` the app binds when `[server.tls]` is set: it
//!    drives each rustls handshake off the accept loop, under a per-connection
//!    timeout, so neither a failed nor a stalled handshake can wedge the
//!    server.
//! 5. **Renewal** — [`CertReloader`](crate::tls::CertReloader) polls the
//!    cert/key mtimes and swaps the resolver's certificate when they change, so
//!    a `certbot`/ACME renewal is picked up without a restart.
//!
//! The crypto backend is `ring`, the SAME backend the outbound Postgres TLS
//! path already uses — the workspace deliberately forbids a second TLS backend
//! (no aws-lc-rs / native-tls / openssl).

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). The one exception is `now_unix` below: certificate validity
// is judged against real wall time by design, and it carries a per-site
// #[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")].
#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::disallowed_methods))]
