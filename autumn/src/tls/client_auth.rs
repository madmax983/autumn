//! Mutual-TLS client-certificate verification (issue #1640).
//!
//! Builds on #1603's listener: when `[server.tls.client_auth]` names a PEM
//! bundle of client CAs, the handshake requests — and verifies — a client
//! certificate, and the verified identity flows to handlers and policies.
//!
//! (`lib.rs` carries an outer doc comment on `pub mod tls`, which is merged
//! with this block, so every link below is fully qualified — a bare item name
//! would resolve in the crate root instead of here.)
//!
//! **The trust store**
//!
//! 1. **Fail-fast loading** —
//!    [`load_client_roots`](crate::tls::client_auth::load_client_roots) and
//!    [`load_crls`](crate::tls::client_auth::load_crls) reject a missing,
//!    unparseable, or empty bundle, naming the path; when a CRL is configured,
//!    [`ensure_crl_coverage`](crate::tls::client_auth::ensure_crl_coverage)
//!    additionally requires a CRL for *every* CA in the bundle, because rustls
//!    denies handshakes with unknown revocation status once any CRL exists
//!    (issue #2706).
//! 2. **A swappable verifier** —
//!    [`ReloadableClientVerifier`](crate::tls::client_auth::ReloadableClientVerifier)
//!    holds the current `rustls` verifier behind an `RwLock`, so a CA rotation
//!    swaps atomically without dropping the listener or established
//!    connections.
//! 3. **Rotation** —
//!    [`ClientTrustReloader`](crate::tls::client_auth::ClientTrustReloader)
//!    polls the bundle and CRL mtimes, mirroring
//!    [`CertReloader`](crate::tls::CertReloader).
//!
//! **The request surface**
//!
//! 4. **Identity** —
//!    [`ClientIdentity`](crate::tls::client_auth::ClientIdentity) is the parsed
//!    subject DN, issuer DN, SANs, fingerprint and serial.
//! 5. **Plumbing** —
//!    [`ClientIdentityLayer`](crate::tls::client_auth::ClientIdentityLayer)
//!    turns the listener's
//!    [`TlsConnectInfo`](crate::tls::TlsConnectInfo) into the per-request
//!    surface: a re-stamped `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>`, the identity as a
//!    request extension, and the ambient scope
//!    [`current_client_identity`](crate::tls::client_auth::current_client_identity)
//!    (and so `PolicyContext`) reads.
//! 6. **Extractors** —
//!    [`ClientCert`](crate::tls::client_auth::ClientCert) and
//!    [`OptionalClientCert`](crate::tls::client_auth::OptionalClientCert).
//! 7. **Per-route enforcement** —
//!    [`RequireClientCertLayer`](crate::tls::client_auth::RequireClientCertLayer),
//!    which the framework applies with the configured `required_paths`.
//!
//! **Operations**
//!
//! 8. **Diagnostics** —
//!    [`RejectionReason`](crate::tls::client_auth::RejectionReason) classifies a
//!    rejected handshake so the operator sees *why*, rate-limited, while the
//!    client sees only the standard TLS alert.
//! 9. **Offline inspection** —
//!    [`inspect_client_ca_bundle`](crate::tls::client_auth::inspect_client_ca_bundle)
//!    and [`inspect_crl`](crate::tls::client_auth::inspect_crl) back the
//!    `autumn doctor` checks.
//!
//! Revocation is a static CRL file only; OCSP is out of scope.

// autumn-determinism-gate: production code in this module must read time and
// mint identifiers through the framework's injected seams (ClockSource /
// Entropy), never `Instant::now()` / `Utc::now()` / `SystemTime::now()` /
// `Uuid::new_v4()` directly. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate"
// (issue #1797). Certificate validity and the rejection-log rate limiter are
// judged against real wall time by design, and read it through
// `super::now_unix`, which carries the module's one documented
