//! An offline edit merges convergently on reconnect (issue #1806, AC4).
//!
//! The offline-sync engine resolves a conflicting push with
//! last-write-wins: the older write is discarded. That is data loss for a
//! collaborative field. [`CollabResolver`] changes the verdict for those
//! fields only — it merges the two documents — and keeps last-write-wins for
//! every other column of the same row.
