//! Does a background job inherit the enqueuing request's tenant, or run with
//! none at all? (Warden 2026-09-16, negative result)
//!
//! Ranked attack surface #3 ("Tenancy and sharding") in Warden's charter asks
//! this exactly: "does a job inherit the enqueuing request's tenant or the
//! executing worker's?" A plausible failure mode: `#[job(...)]::enqueue(...)`
//! is called from inside a request that `tenancy_middleware` has already
//! scoped with `CURRENT_TENANT.scope(Some(tenant_id), ...)`
//! (`autumn/src/tenancy.rs`), and if the job runtime dispatched the handler
//! from *within* that same future tree (e.g. `tokio::spawn`ing the handler
//! directly off the request's task), the handler would inherit the
//! enqueuing tenant as ambient state — and, worse, a *worker* draining a
//! multi-tenant queue could inherit whichever tenant happened to scope the
//! thread that last polled it, misattributing one tenant's job to another's
//! `#[repository(tenant_scoped)]` reads and writes.
//!
//! It does not happen. `autumn/src/job.rs`, `autumn/src/scheduler.rs` and
//! `autumn-macros/src/job.rs` contain zero references to `CURRENT_TENANT` or
//! `tenancy` (`grep -ni tenant` across all three returns nothing): nothing in
//! the job runtime ever reads the enqueuing request's tenant, and nothing
//! ever establishes one before a handler runs.
//!
//! Two independent proofs, run in sequence rather than concurrently:
//!
//! 1. `TestApp::build` starts the in-process worker by default, and it drains
//!    and runs every enqueued job on its own — this is the real production
//!    dispatch path. `job_dispatch_carries_no_ambient_tenant` waits for that
//!    worker to actually run the probe job (`wait_until`, mirroring
//!    `job_recorder_integration.rs`'s own pattern) and asserts what it
//!    observed.
//! 2. `TestApp::perform_enqueued_jobs()` *separately* invokes the same
//!    registered handler again (it drains its own recorder of enqueue calls,
//!    independent of the real queue the worker already consumed), matching
//!    the framework's documented tool for asserting job-execution outcomes
//!    synchronously.
//!
//! A prior version of this test called only `perform_enqueued_jobs()` and
//! asserted a single shared static's final value. Since the in-process worker
//! *also* runs the same job concurrently and writes to the same place, that
//! was racy in a way that could mask a real leak: if the worker's dispatch
//! path leaked a tenant but `perform_enqueued_jobs()`'s direct-invocation
//! path (the *only* path this file actually exercised) did not, the clean
//! second write could silently overwrite the leaked first one before the
//! assertion ever read it — passing green while proving nothing about the
//! real worker path a production deployment actually uses. Fixed by phase 1
//! above: waiting for and asserting the worker's own run first, before phase
//! 2 resets and exercises `perform_enqueued_jobs()` on a fresh observation.
//!
//! This is the safe half of a two-part guarantee. The other half — that a
//! `#[repository(tenant_scoped)]` derived query run with no tenant context
//! fails closed with "no tenant context was established," rather than
//! silently reading unscoped or across tenants — is already proven by
//! `autumn/tests/integration/tenancy.rs::test_unscoped_query_without_context_fails`.
//! Together the two tests close the loop this file's hypothesis opened: a job
//! handler that touches a tenant-scoped repository without itself calling
//! `autumn_web::tenancy::with_tenant(..)` on a tenant id it threaded through
//! its own job args gets a loud `AutumnError`, never another tenant's rows.
//! Recording this as a regression gate: a future change that makes the job
//! runtime "convenient" by ambiently propagating the enqueuing tenant would
//! reintroduce exactly the misattribution this test rules out today.
