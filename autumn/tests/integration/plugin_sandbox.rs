//! End-to-end evidence for the capability-sandboxed plugin lane (issue #1609).
//!
//! The unit tests in `plugin_sandbox::host` prove each containment in
//! isolation. This suite proves the thing an operator actually cares about: a
//! packaged artifact, installed into a real app, serving real requests — and an
//! adversarial corpus that cannot get out of it, cannot take the process down,
//! and cannot stop any other route from serving.
