//! End-to-end evidence for the grown capability vocabulary (issue #1632).
//!
//! `plugin_sandbox::capability`'s unit tests prove each rule in isolation, with
//! a runtime built by hand. This suite proves the thing an operator actually
//! cares about: a **packaged artifact**, loaded into the real sandbox, running
//! real WebAssembly, asking for capabilities over the real wire — and an
//! adversarial corpus that cannot get out of it.
//!
//! The corpus below is the issue's success metric. Ten attempts share the
//! table-driven `the_escape_corpus_is_contained_end_to_end`; seven more are
//! named tests of their own, because each needs a fixture the table cannot
//! carry — a second tenant, a second plugin, a live router, a wall clock.
//! Seventeen in total, and every one of them checks the containment *and*
//! checks that the refusal reached the operator audit surface, because a denial
//! nobody can see is not evidence of anything.
//!
//! Two of them are worth reading before the rest, because they are the shape
//! this suite got wrong the first time:
//!
//! * `/kv-other-tenant` answers 200 only on a **hit**. `kv-get` for a key
//!   another tenant owns is correctly *allowed* and correctly *misses* — the
//!   escaping in `namespaced_key` is what makes it miss — so a test that read
//!   the call's status could not tell containment from success, and demanded a
//!   403 that will never come.
//! * `/fetch-twice` makes two outbound calls in one request. A guest that makes
//!   one call can never demonstrate a per-request ceiling, so the quota test
//!   that drove it asserted three successes and no denial at all.
