//! Dedicated per-queue capacity contract test for issue #1623 (AC5).
//!
//! Proves the headline guarantee: with one queue saturated by slow jobs, a job
//! enqueued to a queue with **dedicated** capacity (`reserved` slots) is claimed
//! promptly instead of waiting behind the flood.
//!
//! Topology: `jobs.workers = 2`, and the `critical` queue reserves `1` slot. A
//! flood on `bulk` may therefore occupy at most `1` (shared) slot, leaving the
//! other worker free for `critical`'s reserved capacity. A `critical` job
//! enqueued while `bulk` is saturated must start almost immediately.
//!
//! Requires Docker (testcontainers Redis) and is marked `#[ignore]`. Run:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p autumn-web --features redis,db \
//!   --test integration_tests queue_dedicated_capacity -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Gated on `#[cfg(feature = "redis")]` so it always compiles.
