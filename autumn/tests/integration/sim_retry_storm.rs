//! Sim-testing worked example (W7, issue #1797): a genuine whole-app
//! concurrency bug the deterministic simulation harness catches that a
//! conventional (real-clock) integration test cannot.
//!
//! The local job runtime's retry backoff (`execute_local_job`,
//! `autumn/src/job.rs`) computed a **pure exponential delay with no jitter**:
//! `initial_backoff_ms * 2^(attempt - 1)`. That delay is a function of the job's
//! *configuration* only — not its identity — so when several jobs in the same
//! queue fail at the same instant (a downstream dependency blips and takes
//! every in-flight job down with it), every one of them computes the *exact
//! same* delay and therefore retries at the *exact same* instant: a
//! synchronized "thundering herd" that immediately re-floods the dependency it
//! just backed off from, instead of spreading the retry load.
//!
//! A real-clock integration test cannot reproduce this on purpose: it would
//! need N real jobs to fail within the same millisecond of wall-clock time, a
//! coincidence no ordinary test schedule can force, let alone rerun
//! deterministically to prove a fix. Under the sim's virtual clock, "N jobs
//! failing at the same instant" isn't a timing fluke to hope for — it is the
//! deterministic, trivially-constructed condition this test builds directly:
//! the paused runtime lets zero real time elapse between enqueuing the jobs and
//! draining their first (failing) attempt.
//!
//! The fix (`jittered_retry_delay_ms` in `autumn/src/job.rs`) draws an
//! equal-jitter spread from the framework's injected [`autumn_web::entropy::Entropy`]
//! seam (`state.entropy()`) — the same source the [`autumn_web::entropy::Rng`]
//! extractor and deterministic `Uuid` helpers draw from — so the herd spreads
//! out using real OS entropy in production, while staying bit-for-bit
//! reproducible under a fixed `#[sim_test]` seed.
//!
//! # Observing sub-window timing under the sim
//!
//! Neither the framework's injected [`autumn_web::time::ClockSource`] nor
//! Tokio's own paused clock is useful for observing *when within* a single big
//! [`Sim::advance`] call a retry fired: both jump straight to the target
//! instant in one step before any timer runs, so every task woken by that
//! advance reads the *same* `now()` regardless of its individual deadline.
//! Distinguishing "fired at delay=520ms" from "fired at delay=980ms" therefore
//! needs the *test* to step through the window in bounded increments and
//! record which increment each retry landed in — the technique this test uses
//! (`CHECKPOINT`).
//!
//! `retries_are_not_synchronized_under_load` is the `DoD` proof for this wave:
//! reverting `jittered_retry_delay_ms` to the old unjittered
//! `backoff_ms.saturating_mul(2_u64.saturating_pow(attempt - 1))` locally and
//! rerunning this test reproduces the herd — every retry lands in the exact
//! same checkpoint bucket — and the assertion below fails, printing the
//! deterministic `AUTUMN_SIM_SEED=…` replay line (`#[sim_test]` prints it on
//! *any* panic, not just an `always!` violation). With the fix in place the
//! same seed passes. This is a plain `assert!`, not `always!`: a spread is
//! overwhelmingly likely for a correctly-jittered seed but not guaranteed by
//! construction, so it isn't a hard invariant in the DST sense (see the
//! comment beside the assertion itself for the full reasoning).
//!
//! # Seeded entropy
//!
//! The jitter draws from `state.entropy()`. The first draft of this test ran
//! when `Sim::build` left entropy to the OS, so the spread came from real
//! `OsEntropy`: the test still passed, but a failure would **not** have
//! reproduced from the printed `AUTUMN_SIM_SEED` replay line. `Sim::build` now
//! seeds the app's entropy from `sim.seed` by default, and
//! `retry_checkpoints_replay_deterministically_from_the_seed` below runs the
//! same seed twice and asserts on the identical outcome.
