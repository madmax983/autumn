//! Isolated integration test: deciding a response value is unacceptable must
//! not cost a copy of it.
//!
//! Two questions the wire asks about guest-chosen strings, both answerable on
//! the borrowed value and both answered by lower-casing it first:
//!
//! - is a `Location` segment a double-dot segment, in any of its four
//!   spellings; and
//! - is a declared content type on the allowlist.
//!
//! A guest chooses those lengths — a header value is bounded only by the
//! stdout-line ceiling, roughly twice the response ceiling — and `run` is
//! holding the parsed response and its clone while the question is asked. So a
//! copy made to answer it is a third live copy of the same bytes, against a
//! footprint term that budgets fewer.
//!
//! Measured rather than asserted structurally, for the same reason as the
//! request-header gate beside it: the *answer* is identical either way. A test
//! that inspects the returned verdict passes against the defect. Allocation is
//! the observable.
//!
//! Its own binary because `allocation-counter` installs a counting
//! `#[global_allocator]`, a process-wide side effect per CLAUDE.md's
//! isolated-test rules.
