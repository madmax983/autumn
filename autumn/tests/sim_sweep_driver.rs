//! W6 PR3 Definition-of-Done proof (sim-testing, issue #1797): the seed-sweep
//! runner finds and shrinks an injected invariant break across a batch of
//! seeds, the failing seed it reports is deterministic across repeated
//! sweeps, and the cross-seed `sometimes!` non-vacuity aggregate fires when a
//! reachability label is observed but never satisfied anywhere in the swept
//! range.
//!
//! Reuses `tests/sim_op_driver.rs`'s worked example (an account balance with
//! an intentionally unfloored `Withdraw`) rather than inventing a new bug —
//! this file's only job is the *sweep* mechanism (`sweep_proptest` batching
//! `Sim::run_proptest` sequentially across seeds, fail-fast, plus cross-seed
//! `sometimes!` aggregation), not re-proving the op-driver shrink mechanism
//! itself (that's `sim_op_driver`'s job).
//!
//! Isolated `[[test]]` binary for the same reason as `sim_op_driver`: needs
//! the `sim-testing` feature (`proptest` as a library dependency), which the
//! default-feature consolidated `integration_tests` binary does not enable,
//! so the file is `#![cfg(feature = "sim-testing")]` and a default
//! `cargo test` compiles it to an empty (passing) binary. Runs without
//! Docker. Run:
//! `cargo test -p autumn-web --features sim-testing --test sim_sweep_driver`.
