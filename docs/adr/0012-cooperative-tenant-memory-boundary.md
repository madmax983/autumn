# ADR 0012: Cooperative tenant scratch-memory boundary

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-20

## Context

Autumn forbids unsafe code. Stable safe Rust cannot transparently intercept
every allocation performed by application and third-party code, nor can an
ordinary library replace allocation for `Vec`, `String`, `Box`, futures,
database drivers, response bodies, TLS, or allocator metadata. Calling the old
byte counter hard memory isolation would therefore be false.

## Decision

The enforceable boundary is **cooperative tracked memory**. Each tenant ID maps
to exactly one resident accounting domain in the `AppState`-owned
`TenantCellRegistry`. `TenantArena` is the safe region facade. Its supported
owned allocation classes are fixed-size `TenantBytes` and `TenantString` plus
the cell-owned keyed byte scratch store. Their capacity/accounting ownership
cannot be separated: a successful allocation owns an RAII charge, and dropping
the value releases it. A finite quota admits an allocation only when the new
tracked total is at most the quota; a failed reservation changes neither usage
nor reachability. Quota/allocation failures map to HTTP 503.

`try_charge` remains a compatibility accounting primitive, but is only a
cooperative declaration and does not own the caller's allocation. It is not an
isolation mechanism. The following remain outside the boundary:

- bare Rust heap values (`Vec`, `String`, `Box`, collections, futures);
- request/response bodies and framework, database, TLS, cache, and plugin memory;
- thread/task stacks, allocator metadata, fragmentation, and size-class rounding;
- native/global allocations and allocations made before an arena call.

Thus Autumn explicitly rejects the claim that a tenant's RSS or arbitrary Rust
heap allocation is bounded. Hard isolation requires a process/container/VM or
a future allocator integration with a separately reviewed safety architecture.

## Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Bound: tenancy resolves request / bind lazy handle
    Bound --> Domain: first arena access / one registry domain per tenant
    Domain --> Owned: successful reserve then allocate / value owns charge
    Domain --> Domain: failed reserve / usage and reachability unchanged / 503
    Owned --> EvictedAlive: registry eviction with outstanding Arc/value references
    Owned --> Domain: allocation dropped / release charge
    Domain --> Reclaimed: eviction with no outstanding references
    EvictedAlive --> EvictedAlive: outstanding references remain usable
    EvictedAlive --> Owned: later request rebinds same live domain and usage
    EvictedAlive --> Reclaimed: final reference drops / arena, allocations, gauge reclaimed
    Reclaimed --> [*]: modeled reachable allocations = 0
```

Eviction removes only the registry reference. It does not invalidate an
in-flight request; final reclamation occurs only after every outstanding
reference and arena-owned value is dropped. The registry's weak lifecycle map
prevents quota reset across generations: if a new request for the same tenant
arrives while an evicted domain is still live (an arena allocation keeps it
alive), the registry rebinds that domain and its existing usage instead of
creating a zero-usage accounting domain.

## Verification and consequences

`verification/tenant_arena.rs` specifies and proves the accounting transition
spine: stable tenant/domain binding, finite-quota preservation, failed-reserve
non-mutation, and zero reachability after final teardown. Runtime tests cover
the observable allocation, concurrency, HTTP, eviction, and drop behavior.

The trade-off is explicit cooperation: supported scratch values are enforceably
owned and accounted, while application authors must not infer whole-process or
hard multi-tenant memory isolation.
