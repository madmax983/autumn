# ADR 0014 [deferred]: Fleet-Wide Coordination For The Custom-Domain Issuance Budget

- Status: Deferred

## Decision under review

Issue #2644 ("Custom domains: issuance budgets reset on restart, so a crash
loop can outrun the advertised caps") lays out three implementation options
for fixing `IssuanceLimiter`'s durability gap, of increasing scope:

1. Persist the attempt log next to the existing per-domain record.
2. Derive an approximate window from already-durable certificate timestamps.
3. Coordinate the budget through a distributed backend, so `global_per_hour`
   is enforced fleet-wide rather than per process.

Only option 3 is an architecture question. Options 1 and 2 are ordinary
bug fixes against the bug's own acceptance criteria and need no review; this
ADR exists to decide whether option 3's fleet-wide coordination should be
built now, alongside the fix, or deferred.

## Door class and reversal cost

**Two-way door**, but reversal is not the bare storage swap this ADR
originally described. `check` (`tenant_domains.rs:851`) runs before the
per-hostname fleet lease is even acquired, and `record_attempt`
(`tenant_domains.rs:931`) runs after two subsequent awaited calls
(`try_acquire`, `record_issuing_for`) — a real gap, not a formality. The
per-hostname lease excludes a second replica from racing the *same*
hostname through that gap, but does nothing for two replicas each ordering
a *different* hostname: both can call `check` and see capacity before
either calls `record_attempt`, a classic check-then-act race. Swapping
`RwLock<Attempts>` for a durable or distributed store behind the same two
separate calls would not close that race; a correct option 3 needs an
atomic check-and-reserve operation (or a global guard spanning both calls),
which is a real interface change at the one call site, not only an
internal one. That is more work than a pure storage swap, but it is still
contained to `tenant_domains.rs`'s `issue_one` and `IssuanceLimiter`'s
public methods — reversal in either direction (add atomic fleet-wide
reservation, or strip it back to today's two-call shape) stays a
same-crate, few-function change, not a rearchitecture. Per this framework's
own rule, a door this cheap is normally a PR-level call, not an ADR; it is
recorded here only because #2644 already staged the fleet-wide option as
one of three named choices, and taking it without evidence would be
exactly the "deciding a two-way door by RFC" mistake this framework warns
against in the other direction — so this ADR's job is to say *no*, in
writing, rather than let the biggest option win by being listed last.

## Evidence (Tier 2 — repository and issue record)

Reproduce with the commands in **Reproduce** below.

1. **The correctness gap is real and already scoped**, not hypothetical.
   #2644 (filed 2026-09-09 by the maintainer, "filed rather than fixed")
   documents four concrete failure modes against `autumn/src/custom_domain.rs`'s
   `IssuanceLimiter`, which keeps both its per-domain and global attempt
   windows in a plain in-process `RwLock<Attempts>` (`HashMap<String, Vec<i64>>`
   plus a `Vec<i64>`), rebuilt empty on every process start — `app.rs`
   constructs a fresh `IssuanceLimiter` at both of its call sites
   (`autumn/src/app.rs:10126,10200`, one for the one-shot retention pruner,
   one for the running web app's custom-domain task).
2. **Three of the four failure modes are single-instance bugs, not
   multi-replica ones.** Restart-resets-the-window (item 1), tick-start
   timestamp skew (item 3), and budget-deferral misclassified as failure
   (item 4) all reproduce on exactly one running instance — they are
   ordinary correctness bugs against the limiter's own documented contract,
   independent of how many replicas exist. Only item 2 ("each replica has
   its own [budget]") is inherently about fleet size.
3. **The minimal fix already has a ready-built seam — for the per-domain
   half.** `CustomDomainStore` (`autumn/src/custom_domain.rs:666`) is
   already a pluggable trait with `MemoryCustomDomainStore` and
   `FsCustomDomainStore` implementations, writing one durable record per
   domain. Durable-state option 1 in #2644 — "the `CustomDomainStore` seam
   already writes per-domain JSON; per-domain attempt timestamps could ride
   on the record, **and the global window in one small file**" — requires
   no new abstraction for the per-domain half; it is additive data on a
   trait that already exists and is already exercised by tests. The global
   half needs its own small durable store, not a ride on `CustomDomainStore`:
   `CustomDomainRegistry::remove_if` (`custom_domain.rs:1670`) deletes a
   domain's record outright, while `IssuanceLimiter::forget`
   (`custom_domain.rs:2010`) only clears that domain's *per-domain* history
   and intentionally leaves its attempts in the global vector — so a global
   window reconstructed from per-domain records would lose an offboarded
   domain's still-counting attempts on the next restart, letting the
   deployment-wide budget run over exactly the case it exists to catch.
4. **This is not a new architecture question — ADR 0004 already answered
   it in the abstract — and this ADR reconciles with, rather than silently
   contradicts, ADR 0004's Category 3 "must."** ADR 0004 ("Externalize
   Distributed Runtime State", 2026-04-09, Status: Proposed) classifies
   "rate-limit counters" — which `IssuanceLimiter` structurally is — as
   Category 3 ("Shared Mutable Runtime State"), and its Decision section
   states plainly: "This must use pluggable external backends in
   production-safe deployments." Read on its own, that "must" is in direct
   tension with this ADR's default path, which leaves the limiter
   per-process — that tension is real and is not resolved by citing ADR
   0004's risks in isolation, as an earlier draft of this ADR did. Read in
   the context ADR 0004 itself gives that sentence, the tension resolves
   instead of just being cited past: the same document names "Supporting
   every possible cache or session backend in Phase 1" a Non-Goal, names
   "adding too many backends too early" and "over-externalizing" as Risks
   to actively avoid, and stages its own rollout one target at a time —
   "the first mandatory externalization target is session state," with the
   rest of Category 3 following as evidence of real need arrives, not as a
   single simultaneous mandate the ADR's date already forces.
   `autumn/src/security/rate_limit.rs` is the proof that rollout happens:
   its `"redis"` backend, documented as "share the budget across all pods,"
   *is* ADR 0004's Category-3 answer, built once a real fleet-wide need
   existed for that specific counter — durable-state option 3 for
   `IssuanceLimiter` would be the same answer, not a cheaper substitute for
   it (see Default path below, which does not claim otherwise). No
   comparable evidenced need has reached `IssuanceLimiter` yet (Evidence
   items 6-7): the default value is miscalibrated, not the architecture
   proven wrong. **This ADR is therefore a scoped, evidence-gated exception
   to ADR 0004's Category 3, not a supersession of it**: it defers *when*
   `IssuanceLimiter` gets a pluggable external backend, using exactly the
   criterion — a real, evidenced fleet-wide need — that ADR 0004's own
   Risks and Non-Goals sections say should gate that decision. It does not
   dispute that the limiter eventually belongs on that backend. The Trigger
   section below is what turns "eventually" into "now."
5. **The seam for fleet-wide coordination, if it is ever needed, already
   exists and needs nothing new built to stay open.** ADR 0010 ("Expose an
   App-Facing Distributed Lock", accepted 2026-07-09) already generalized
   the framework's internal Postgres-advisory-lock primitive
   (`try_pg_advisory_lock`) into an app-facing "run this exactly once across
   the cluster" seam. A future option-3 implementation would reach for that
   primitive rather than inventing a fourth coordination mechanism.
6. **No evidence of multi-replica custom-domain deployment exists in this
   repository — and item 7 shows that is stronger than an absence of
   evidence.** Per ADR 0012's Tier-2 finding, 89.4% of this repository's
   commits are from one human author with no second team; nothing in the
   issue tracker, CI matrix, or example apps demonstrates an operator
   running ≥2 replicas of this feature concurrently, for the same domain or
   different ones (overlap does not matter — see item 7 and the Trigger
   section). Item 2 in #2644 is a real gap in what the code *claims*
   (`global_per_hour` "enforced per process-lifetime-hour, not per hour"),
   and item 7 below shows the exact arithmetic of that gap — but also
   surfaces documented, positive evidence (not merely an absence) that this
   deployment shape does not *succeed* today, for a reason unrelated to the
   budget, even though an operator can still attempt it and spend real
   quota doing so (item 7's `new_order`-before-validation finding). That
   reclassifies this from "thinnest link, watch for a report" to "not
   currently reachable *as a working configuration*, though reachable as a
   quota-wasting one" — see item 7 and Default path for what that changes;
   the revisit trigger below still fires on the first report regardless,
   since an operator can misconfigure past a documented recommendation.
7. **The limiter's own "well inside [the limit]" claim holds only for one
   process, not for the account — but one process is the only topology this
   feature supports today, and "the account" is itself per-replica by
   default, which narrows exactly which multi-replica misconfiguration this
   arithmetic describes.** The shipped defaults are
   `issuance_per_domain_per_day = 5` and `issuance_global_per_hour = 50`
   (`config.rs:10228-10235`). At 50/hour, one process can attempt 150 orders
   in any rolling 3-hour window — the same window Let's Encrypt measures
   its 300-orders-per-account limit over. `FsAcmeStore` keeps the ACME
   account (`account.json`) under each replica's own local `cache_dir`
   (`autumn/src/acme/store.rs:1-9,128-134`), and `docs/guide/tls.md:426-445`
   says that store is local disk by default — "to run ACME across replicas
   at all, `cache_dir` must be on storage every replica shares." So the
   "two replicas sum to 150+150=300, the account's entire quota" arithmetic
   assumes replicas sharing that storage (and hence one `account.json`); a
   deployment that instead runs ≥2 replicas each with its own local
   `cache_dir` — the more naive misconfiguration — gets ≥2 *separate* ACME
   accounts, each with its own separate 300-per-3-hours allowance, and
   50/hour (150/3h) stays under that on its own. "Well inside the
   limit... at the defaults" is true at N=1 and, for a deployment with
   per-replica accounts, stays true per-account at N=2 as well; it is the
   shared-`cache_dir` case where N=2 already *equals* the one account's
   entire quota and N=3 exceeds it by 50%. Separately from that
   shared-account arithmetic, `docs/guide/tls.md:901-907` and `:426-427`
   document, independently of this ADR, that custom domains are
   **single-host only** regardless of storage sharing: "the HTTP-01 token
   map and the certificate store are per-process, so behind a load balancer
   the CA's validation request usually reaches a replica that never
   published the token. Run custom domains on a single host." A deployment
   cannot run this feature *correctly* on ≥2 replicas today either way —
   HTTP-01 validation breaks first, for a reason that has nothing to do
   with the issuance budget. But "breaks first" is about whether a
   certificate is *issued*, not about whether an attempt *consumes budget*:
   `AcmeDomainIssuer::order` calls `new_order` (`tenant_domains.rs:106-109`)
   — the call Let's Encrypt counts — *before*
   `answer_http01`/`await_order_ready` (`:114-115`) validates the
   challenge. An operator who runs ≥2 replicas despite the documented
   requirement still creates a real order, spending real quota against
   *whichever* account that replica holds, on every attempt that lands on a
   replica without the winning token — even though that order then fails
   validation and no certificate issues. That per-account waste is live
   regardless of whether `cache_dir` is shared; only the *shared-quota*,
   N-sums-to-one-account version of the arithmetic needs shared storage
   (see Do nothing below for what that changes).

## Do nothing / decide later — 12-month baseline

"Do nothing" is not actually on the table here — items 1, 3, and 4 are
correctness bugs against the limiter's own documented guarantee ("well
inside Let's Encrypt's 300-new-orders-per-account-per-3-hours limit... a
permanently broken domain converges to one attempt per `max_backoff_secs`"),
and that guarantee is what stands between a misconfigured or crash-looping
deployment and Let's Encrypt rate-limiting the account for every tenant on
it, not just the broken one. Fixing those three — item 1 via durable-state
option 1, items 3 and 4 as their own small, independent fixes — is due
regardless of this ADR; all three already carry acceptance criteria in
#2644. The question this ADR answers is narrower: whether to *also* build
fleet-wide coordination (durable-state option 3) in the same pass.

If durable-state option 3 is deferred and only items 1, 3, and 4 are
fixed (via durable-state option 1 for item 1): a deployment running
multiple replicas that are all actively issuing custom-domain certificates
would get up to N× the advertised `global_per_hour` budget, same as today,
where N is replica count. Per Evidence item 7, what that N× buys depends on
whether replicas share `cache_dir` (and so one ACME account): sharing it,
N=2 already *equals* Let's Encrypt's outer limit (300 orders/3h/account)
rather than staying safely under it; not sharing it — the more naive
misconfiguration — gives each replica its own separate account and its own
separate 300/3h allowance, under which 50/hour stays safely regardless of
N. `docs/guide/tls.md` already documents custom domains as single-host
only, for the independent reason that HTTP-01 validation does not survive
a load balancer today — so the *feature* cannot succeed on ≥2 replicas
either way. The 12-month baseline is **not**, however, zero even in the
separate-accounts case: per Evidence item 7's `new_order`-before-validation
ordering, an operator who runs ≥2 replicas anyway still spends real order
quota, against whichever account each replica holds, on every attempt —
whether or not that attempt goes on to fail HTTP-01. Nothing in the record
shows a deployment currently doing this (Evidence item 6) — but if one did
with a *shared* `cache_dir`, the exposure is more than wasted throughput:
enough failed attempts across enough replicas can exhaust that one shared
account's rate limit, which then blocks the deployment's *own* certificate
too, since `docs/guide/tls.md` also documents that "every tenant order uses
the same ACME account as your own certificate" (true within one replica's
account regardless of sharing — the sharing question is only about whether
*multiple replicas'* attempts land on that same account). With separate
per-replica accounts, the exposure narrows to each replica separately
wasting its own account's quota, potentially affecting only that replica's
own certificate. Either way, this is gated by an operator ignoring a
documented requirement, not by a design flaw this review can fix with a
default-value change — no value of `global_per_hour` stops N independent
processes from each spending their own share unaware of the others; only
genuine fleet coordination (durable-state option 3, still correctly
deferred above) or detecting/refusing multi-replica operation (a
different, smaller fix this ADR does not scope) closes it. That is not
true of items 1, 3, and 4, which are live single-instance bugs today
regardless. The N=2 arithmetic and the quota-before-validation finding are
recorded here so that whoever eventually externalizes the per-process
pieces standing between here and real multi-replica support — the HTTP-01
token map, the certificate store, and (per the Trigger section below) the
domain registry — does not also have to rediscover that the issuance
budget, and its dependence on account sharing, needs the same trip.

## Impact floor check

Five of the six clearing conditions are not met for *building durable-state
option 3*: no Tier-1 incident data (no reported case of multi-replica
budget overrun, order-quota waste included); no cross-team change count to
reduce (single-maintainer repository, per ADR 0012); no dated Tier-4 fact —
Let's Encrypt's limit is real, and per Evidence item 7 an operator running
≥2 replicas against documented advice would spend real quota against it
today, not just once the feature is supported — but nothing assigns a date
or an owner to closing that anyway, and (per Do nothing above) no default
value closes it regardless; no removed cost exceeding a migration cost (no
cost is currently *known to be* paid — Evidence item 6 found no record of
anyone running this configuration, documented or not); no ≥3-data-point
asymptotic trend (this is the first and only instance of a hand-rolled,
non-pluggable "shared mutable runtime state" counter found in this pass —
see Reproduce for the negative search across
`plugin_sandbox::capability::quota` and other `*Limiter`/`*Budget`/`*Quota`
structs, all of which are correctly request- or process-scoped by design,
not mis-scoped copies of this same problem).

**The sixth — a Tier-3 spike, or equivalent computed proof, showing the
design fails a committed requirement — deserves a real look, and a first
pass through this review concluded it was met. On closer reading it is
not, which is worth recording rather than quietly dropping.** Evidence item
7's arithmetic (N=2 replicas sharing one ACME account exactly consume
Let's Encrypt's 3-hour limit for it) looked like exactly the proof
condition 4 asks for: not "might struggle
with," but an exact failure of the limiter's own documented guarantee at a
specific, named N. But a "committed requirement" a design can fail has to
describe a configuration the design is actually committed to supporting —
and `docs/guide/tls.md:901-907` already documents, independently of this
ADR and for an unrelated reason (HTTP-01 token-map and certificate-store
locality), that custom domains run single-host only. The limiter's "well
inside the limit... at the defaults" guarantee is implicitly scoped to the
one topology this feature *succeeds* on, N=1, where the arithmetic holds
exactly as claimed. Item 7's N=2 case is real arithmetic an operator *can*
still trigger by running ≥2 replicas anyway — Evidence item 7's
`new_order`-before-validation finding means the attempt is not blocked, only
doomed — but a "committed requirement" is about what the design promises
for a configuration it supports, and single-host is the only one it
promises anything for. Condition 4 is therefore **not** met after all — no
Tier-3-equivalent proof exists against the design this feature is
committed to today. Combined with the other five conditions above, none of
the six are met: this does not clear the floor for durable-state option 3,
and per Evidence item 4 that non-clearance is an explicit, evidence-gated
exception to ADR 0004's Category 3 "must," not a claim that
`IssuanceLimiter` never needs a pluggable backend — only that no evidenced,
*reachable* need has reached it yet.

## Default path

Ship durable-state option 1 from #2644 (for failure-mode item 1), together
with the independent fixes for items 3 and 4, as ordinary PR-level bug
fixes against that issue's existing acceptance criteria: persist per-domain
attempt timestamps on the existing `CustomDomainStore` record, persist the
global attempt window separately in its own small durable store rather than
deriving it from per-domain records (see Evidence item 3 above for why),
stamp attempts with their own time rather than the tick's start time, and
route a budget deferral through `retry_after_secs` instead of the generic
failure/backoff path. None of this needs architecture review — it is
additive state on an existing trait plus one small new durable store,
exactly the shape ADR 0012 and 0013 both found to be routine engineering
rather than a door worth an ADR. Leave the limiter's *coordination* model
per-process; do not add a Redis or Postgres-backed cross-replica layer for
it in this pass — durability and cross-replica coordination are separate
questions, and only the latter is what this ADR defers.

No fifth action item is added. An earlier pass through this review proposed
lowering `default_custom_domains_global_per_hour` (`config.rs:10233`,
currently `50`) to cover a multi-replica margin — but per Evidence item 7,
custom domains are documented single-host only for a reason (HTTP-01
token-map and certificate-store locality) this ADR's scope does not touch,
so a deployment running ≥2 replicas of this feature has no working
certificates to protect, only quota it would waste regardless of what
`global_per_hour` is set to (per Do nothing above, no default value stops
N unaware processes from each spending their own share). Lowering the
default today would only shrink issuance throughput for the one topology
this feature actually succeeds on, in exchange for guarding a topology
that stays broken and wasteful at any default — the same "narrows options
for a benefit you could not measure" mistake this framework's own
banned-changes list warns against. The right trigger for
recalibrating `global_per_hour` is not this ADR's trigger below; it is
whoever externalizes the HTTP-01 token map and certificate store to make
multi-replica custom domains real, who should read Evidence item 7 before
shipping that and pick a default that accounts for it then.

## Seam kept open

One seam already exists; one small seam is new but ships as part of the
default path's ordinary bug fix, not as something option 3 must add later:

- `CustomDomainStore` already abstracts *per-domain* persistence behind a
  trait with swappable implementations (`load_all`/`save`/`delete` on one
  `CustomDomain` at a time), so a future backend for the per-domain half of
  the attempt log is additive, not a rewrite of `IssuanceLimiter`'s call
  sites. It cannot serve the global window, though: it has no operation for
  a single deployment-wide value, only per-record ones. The default path's
  own small durable store for the global window (see Default path above) is
  therefore a new seam — but it is built now, as part of the ordinary fix
  for items 1/3/4, not deferred alongside option 3. Once it exists, a later
  option-3 implementation extends it rather than inventing persistence from
  scratch.
- ADR 0010's app-facing distributed lock already provides the "exactly once
  across the cluster" primitive a fleet-wide `global_per_hour` enforcement
  would coordinate through, so building option 3 later starts from an
  existing, tested primitive rather than a new one. Building it correctly
  means using that lock to make `check` and `record_attempt` an atomic
  check-and-reserve (or wrapping both calls in one held lock) — see Door
  class above — not merely pointing the existing two-call interface at a
  shared store.

## Trigger to revisit

Revisit the durable-state-option-3 (fleet-wide coordination) decision if
any of the following occurs:

- **Multi-replica custom domains become a genuinely supported topology.**
  That needs more than the HTTP-01 token map and certificate store
  `docs/guide/tls.md:901-907` names — `CustomDomainRegistry` is a third
  per-process piece: it is backed by a local `FsCustomDomainStore`,
  hydrates a one-time index at boot (`hydrate_index`/`is_hydrated`,
  `custom_domain.rs:978-1032`), and has no cross-replica refresh or
  invalidation path, so a registration one replica handles stays invisible
  to the others even once tokens and certificates are shared. All three —
  token map, certificate store, and registry — externalizing or
  synchronizing is the real prerequisite. At that point Evidence item 7's
  N=2 arithmetic stops being about an attempt that only wastes quota and
  starts being about the throughput operators can actually rely on —
  recalibrate `global_per_hour`'s default and re-open this decision before
  declaring that support production-safe, not after.
- An operator reports running ≥2 replicas that concurrently issue
  custom-domain certificates today, despite the documented single-host
  requirement — for the same hostname or different ones. The fleet lease in
  `tenant_domains.rs::issue_one` is keyed per-hostname
  (`format!("custom-domain:{hostname}")`, "one replica per hostname
  orders"), so it excludes a second replica from racing the *same* domain
  but does nothing to stop two replicas issuing for *different* domains at
  the same time, each checked against its own process-local
  `global_per_hour` allowance. Overlapping domain sets are not required for
  the per-process budget gap (#2644 item 2) to produce observed
  over-issuance — disjoint domains issued concurrently across replicas
  already multiply the advertised budget by replica count, on top of
  whatever HTTP-01 validation failures that unsupported topology already
  causes.
- A deployment is documented approaching Let's Encrypt's outer
  300-orders-per-3-hours account limit some other way, making this
  framework's own budget (rather than the vendor's) the thing that needs to
  hold exactly, not just approximately.

# Sole-maintainer / no-second-team baseline this ADR reuses from ADR 0012.
# IMPORTANT: a shallow clone reports only its fetched slice — unshallow first,
# the same way ADR 0012's and ADR 0013's own reproduce steps do.
