# CI quarantine ledger

Formalizes what the 2026-09-04 CI health census
(`docs/reports/2026-09-04-semaphore-ci-health-census.md`) found this repo
lacked: "no formal ledger exists in this repo (no intake-form/owner/date
convention)." Its one prior example — `cancelled_release_does_not_leak_lock`,
skipped out of `ci.yml`'s Docker sweep with a diagnosis comment but no owner
or diagnose-by date — has since been de-flaked and removed from the skip list
(#2479), so this ledger opens with **zero open entries**, not a backlog.

**No test enters quarantine without an entry here.** A `#[ignore]` or
`--skip` added to work around instability, with nothing recorded below, is
not quarantine — it is a graveyard with a skip annotation, and the next
person to find it has no way to tell a diagnosed, owned wait from an
abandoned one.

## Intake form

Copy this block into a new entry under "Open entries" when quarantining a
test. Every field is required — an entry missing one is not a valid
quarantine, per the rule above.

```
### <test path>::<test name>

- **Quarantined**: <date> in <PR #>
- **Owner**: <github handle> — the person who diagnosed it and is on the
  hook for closing this entry, not necessarily the original test author.
- **Diagnose-by**: <date> — a real date, not "TBD". Missing it means revisit
  this entry, not extend it silently.
- **Rerun-rate baseline**: <k>/<n> from <harness/command>, run <date>.
  Same-commit rerun statistics only — "it's flaky" is not a baseline.
- **Failure signature(s)**: <the actual error/panic text, or a link to one>.
- **Mechanism (if known)**: <root-cause category — shared state, missing
  await/async race, time/timezone dependence, order dependence, unpinned
  external service, resource contention, or product bug — plus the specific
  defect>, or "undiagnosed" if the ledger entry exists only to stop the
  bleeding while triage continues.
- **Linked issue/PR**: <link> — a product bug found via flake triage gets
  filed and linked here, per Semaphore's law 2 ("every flake is a bug — in
  the test or the product — until diagnosed you do not know which").
- **Skip mechanism**: <where in CI this is actually excluded — e.g. `ci.yml`
  `--skip` list, `#[ignore]`, a non-default feature gate> and why that
  mechanism was chosen over the others.
```

## Open entries

None.

## Closed entries

### `distributed_lock::cancelled_release_does_not_leak_lock`

- **Quarantined**: pre-existing before this ledger; exact date/PR not
  recoverable from `ci.yml`'s history alone — the original `--skip` carried
  a diagnosis comment ("flaky wall-clock zero-duration-timeout race; needs
  deterministic/paused time to de-flake") but no owner or date, which is
  exactly the gap this ledger exists to close going forward.
- **Rerun-rate baseline**: 1/30, same-commit rerun protocol (testcontainers
  Postgres), 2026-09-04.
- **Failure signature**: panic "the release should have been cancelled by
  the zero-duration timeout".
- **Mechanism**: `tokio::time::timeout(Duration::ZERO, ...)` assumed an
  already-elapsed timer always wins the poll race against the real
  `pg_advisory_unlock` round-trip; `Timeout::poll` polls the wrapped future
  before checking its timer, so a same-poll resolution never got cancelled.
  Test defect, not a product defect — the underlying `LockGuard`/
  `AcquireConn` cancel-safety this test exists to prove holds regardless
  (confirmed by the revert check: mutating `AcquireConn::drop` to recycle
  instead of force-close did not turn the test red).
- **Resolution**: rewritten to poll `release()` by hand exactly once and
  assert `Poll::Pending` — no timing dependency. 0/50 reruns after the fix,
  revert check passed. Un-quarantined and restored to the Docker sweep.
- **Closed**: 2026-09-04, #2479 (🚦 Semaphore).

### `offsite_backup::offsite_backup_upload_then_restore_round_trips` / `offsite_backup::offsite_backup_uploads_large_artifact_via_multipart` / `sqlite_replication_s3::replicates_to_and_restores_from_a_real_s3_endpoint`

- **Not a flake — a total, deterministic external-dependency outage.**
  Sampling the ~23.3h window since the 2026-09-11 follow-up's cutoff
  (2026-09-11T09:09:24Z–2026-09-12T07:46:03Z) found `Test (Docker)` failing
  on 20 of 24 failed `ci.yml` runs, across completely unrelated branches
  (`claude/*` and `vesper/bugbash-*`, no shared code change). Every one of
  the `autumn-cli` `cli_tests` occurrences checked (run IDs 34668965068,
  34681578354, 34650506433, 34641243320, 34647320725, and others) panics
  identically at `autumn-cli/tests/integration/offsite_backup.rs:213:10`:
  `"start MinIO — is Docker running?: Client(PullImage { descriptor:
  \"minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z\", err:
  DockerResponseServerError { status_code: 404, message: \"pull access
  denied for minio/minio, repository does not exist or may require 'docker
  login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied\" } })"`.
  Since `Test (Docker)` feeds the required `test-gate` aggregator
  (`Test suite`), this was failing the required check on essentially every
  open PR in the repo.
- **Mechanism**: unpinned/vanished external service, not a race or shared
  state. Confirmed directly against Docker Hub's own API
  (`https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/minio/minio/` →
  `{"message":"object not found"}`) that the `minio/minio` repository no
  longer exists on Docker Hub at all — not just this tag. MinIO Inc.
  stopped publishing free images to Docker Hub in October 2025. The
  `testcontainers-modules` crate (pinned at 0.15.0 in `Cargo.lock`) hard-codes
  `minio/minio` as the image name in its `Image` impl, so every
  `MinIO::default()` call in this repo pulled from the now-dead repository,
  100% of the time — this is not stochastic, so no rerun-rate campaign is
  needed to characterize it beyond the cross-commit evidence already in
  hand (dozens of independent commits, zero passes, identical signature).
  The same tagged image is still mirrored byte-for-byte on Quay
  (`quay.io/minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z`, confirmed via
  `quay.io`'s API: identical manifest digest
  `sha256:379b06de0d24339646b6139860b170c39b004818dcec95259ee680997839f7dc`
  to the Docker Hub layer that used to serve this tag).
- **Test-vs-product**: neither — this is test/CI infrastructure depending
  on a third-party image registry outside this repo's control. No product
  code path is implicated.
- **Fix**: redirect every `MinIO::default()` call site to Quay via
  `testcontainers`'s own `ImageExt::with_name("quay.io/minio/minio")`,
  keeping the crate's existing default tag unchanged (same verified
  manifest digest, so container behavior is identical — only the registry
  changes). Applied to all three affected call sites:
  `autumn-cli/tests/integration/offsite_backup.rs` (both tests),
  `autumn/tests/integration/sqlite_replication_s3.rs`, and
  `examples/reddit-clone/tests/avatar_s3_integration.rs` (not part of
  either CI Docker sweep, but the same defect, so fixed for consistency
  rather than left to fail identically whenever someone runs it).
- **Verification**: `cargo check`/`cargo clippy -D warnings` clean on all
  three affected test targets (`autumn-cli --test cli_tests`, `autumn-web
  --test integration_tests --features test-support,offline-sync`,
  `reddit-clone --test avatar_s3_integration`). No Docker daemon is
  available in this sandbox, so the actual container pull could not be
  exercised locally; **CI-native verification is pending on this PR's own
  `Test (Docker)` job**, which exercises the real pull against
  `quay.io/minio/minio` for the first time. Revert check: not applicable in
  the usual sense (nothing in this repo's own logic changed — the defect
  was entirely in an external registry going away), but the `PullImage`
  failure this fix removes is fully reproducible pre-fix (see the run IDs
  above) and specific to the registry, not the tag or image content, so
  restoring `MinIO::default()` without `.with_name(...)` would reproduce
  the identical 404 immediately.
- **Closed**: 2026-09-12, pending this PR's own CI run for the CI-native
  confirmation noted above (🚦 Semaphore). **Confirmed 2026-09-13, then
  scope-corrected same day (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR
  #2768): CI-native verification covers only two of the three fixed
  files, not "this entry's fix" as a whole.** PR #2740's own `Test
  (Docker)` check run (job 103543584136, part of workflow run
  34688787858) completed `success` at 2026-09-12T11:55:09Z, and that run
  does exercise the real `quay.io/minio/minio` pull for
  `autumn-cli/tests/integration/offsite_backup.rs` (via the `autumn-cli`
  Docker sweep) and `autumn/tests/integration/sqlite_replication_s3.rs`
  (via the `autumn` Docker sweep) — both confirmed CI-natively, not just
  locally clippy-clean. **`examples/reddit-clone/tests/avatar_s3_integration.rs`
  is not part of either sweep** (per this repo's own `AGENTS.md`: only the
  `autumn` consolidated `integration_tests` binary and `autumn-cli`'s
  `cli_tests` binary are swept for `#[ignore]`d Docker tests; a separate
  example crate's own test target is reached by neither, and `ci.yml` has
  no dedicated job for it either — confirmed by grep, no match), so its
  `avatar_blob_store_roundtrip` test's actual registry pull remains
  compile-and-clippy-verified only, not CI-exercised, regardless of how
  many times this file was subsequently touched by the escape below. See
  the new escape entry immediately below for a coordination defect this
  fix's merge timing collided with (independent, not a defect in the fix
  itself).

### Escape: four independent fixes for the same MinIO/Docker-Hub outage collided at merge, needing two reconciliation commits — ~8.3h of spurious Lint failures (two disjoint intervals) on 5 branches

- **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2768): the
  original version of this entry named the wrong commits and the wrong
  count.** It attributed the cleanup to #2749/#2750/#2751/#2752 and framed
  this as a two-PR (#2740/#2743) collision. Checked directly against each
  commit's actual diff rather than its title or PR number: #2750
  (`cfb5d93`), #2751 (`6dd7bb1`), and #2749 (`4eeeeac`) are **empty
  merges** — no file changes at all, because by the time each squash-merge
  landed, `trunk-dev` already carried equivalent content from a different,
  concurrently-merging branch. #2752 (`1c5312e`) touches
  `autumn-cli/src/generate/auth.rs`/`schema_edit.rs`/`CHANGELOG.md` only —
  nothing MinIO-related. Corrected below from the actual diffs (`git show
  --stat`/`-p` on every commit that touched the three affected test
  files), not from any commit's own self-description — even the commit
  that removed the dead helper (#2756) misattributes what added it.
- **Second correction (post-review, via a further Codex review comment on
  PR #2768): the lint-fallout window ends at #2756, not #2729.** The
  first correction pass (above) still closed the window at #2729
  (2026-09-13T02:30:05Z) and called it "the actual final resolution."
  Checked directly against the tree at `a7c7c46` (#2756, 02:09:18Z):
  `start_minio()` already has its two live callers, `MINIO_IMAGE` is
  already wired into the avatar test's call site, and `minio_image()` is
  already removed — zero dead code, full stop. #2729 (21 minutes later)
  refactors that already-clean tree (reintroducing and then re-collapsing
  its own branch's separate `minio_image()` copy, entirely within its own
  single squashed commit — trunk-dev itself never saw that intermediate
  state) and adds the regression test; it is a subsequent architectural
  cleanup and a genuinely good side effect, not part of resolving the
  fallout, which had already ended. The impact window and all timing
  below are corrected to close at #2756.
- **Third correction (post-review, via two further Codex review comments
  on PR #2768): "six independent fixes" conflated independent outage
  diagnoses with reactive cleanup commits, and the branch count was
  overstated.** #2756 (9h05 after #2740) only deletes an unused helper —
  it is not an independent diagnosis of the outage, it is cleanup of dead
  code the collision left behind. #2725's own sub-commit message says so
  explicitly: "fix: use the MINIO_IMAGE const **the merge from trunk-dev
  introduced**" — it is repairing dead code its own branch picked up from
  merging `trunk-dev`, not freshly diagnosing the Docker Hub outage.
  Separated below into four independent-diagnosis fixes reacted to by two
  reconciliation commits, not six of a kind. Separately, the claimed "at
  least 6 distinct, unrelated WIP branches" named only five (counting
  `brave-goldberg-gyr60j` once, since its two hits are one branch) — the
  two `fix/reddit-clone-minio-*`/`fix/minio-quay-registry` branches
  mentioned alongside them are not unrelated victims of the fallout, they
  are other sessions' own independent attempts at fixing the outage
  itself, a different category of evidence. Reduced to the 5 branches
  actually confirmed by job-log inspection.
- **Fourth correction (post-review, via two further Codex review comments
  on PR #2768): the lint fallout is two disjoint intervals, not one
  continuous window, and #2740's CI-native verification (above) does not
  cover all three files it touched.** Checked directly against the tree
  at each intermediate commit: `avatar_s3_integration.rs`'s dead-code seed
  (from #2743) was fixed by #2725 at 23:19:07Z, and `offsite_backup.rs`'s
  competing `minio_image()` helper was not introduced until #2720 at
  23:22:06Z — so the tree was briefly, fully dead-code-free for those ~3
  minutes in between, not continuously broken from #2743 to #2756. The
  true accounting is two intervals: 17:46:17Z–23:19:07Z (~5h33m, the
  `MINIO_IMAGE`-unused signature only) and 23:22:06Z–02:09:18Z (~2h47m,
  the `minio_image()`-unused signature only), totaling ~8.3h, not one
  continuous ~8.4h span. Separately: the MinIO/Quay entry's "CI-natively
  verified" note (above) has been scope-corrected — `avatar_s3_integration.rs`'s
  test is outside both Docker sweeps and was never actually run by that
  green `Test (Docker)` job.
- **Not a flake, not a product bug — a coordination gap.** The same
  universally-visible `ci.yml` failure (every `Test (Docker)` run 404ing
  on the dead `minio/minio` Docker Hub repository, regardless of a PR's
  own diff) was independently diagnosed and fixed inside **four separate
  PRs** within a ~6.3 hour window, none aware of the others — consistent
  with this role's own and every other session's "red CI is work now"
  posture: whoever hit the failure on their own PR fixed it in place
  rather than waiting. Two further commits then had to reconcile the
  dead code this collision left behind. Chronology, verified against each
  commit's actual file-level diff and (where quoted) its own commit
  message, not any commit's self-description of *other* commits — even
  the commit that removed the dead helper (#2756) misattributes what
  added it:

  **Independent outage diagnoses (4):**
  - **#2740** (`abacf9e`, this ledger's own fix, merged
    2026-09-12T17:03:51Z): inlined
    `.with_name("quay.io/minio/minio")` at all four call sites across
    `offsite_backup.rs` (both tests), `sqlite_replication_s3.rs`, and
    `avatar_s3_integration.rs`. **No helper function or constant** — the
    original entry's claim that this PR added `minio_image()` is wrong.
  - **#2743** (`d2693c1`, independent, 17:46:17Z, 43 min later):
    added `const MINIO_IMAGE` to `avatar_s3_integration.rs` without wiring
    it into the call site (which already carried #2740's identical inline
    literal by merge time) — the first dead-code seed.
  - **#2722** (`e9f90a7`, an unrelated replay-guard test PR, sub-commit
    "fix: point MinIO testcontainers at quay.io (Docker Hub repo
    pulled)" — its own message independently re-derives the outage from
    its own PR's `Test (Docker)` failure, not from a merge conflict,
    23:21:15Z): introduced a **new** `start_minio()` helper in
    `offsite_backup.rs`, replacing both tests' inline literals from
    #2740.
  - **#2720** (`0917af7`, an unrelated `SeqKey` append-ordering PR,
    sub-commit "fix: MinIO Docker tests point at quay.io, not the dead
    Docker Hub repo" — likewise its own independent re-derivation,
    23:22:06Z, one minute after #2722): independently introduced a
    **second, competing** `minio_image()` helper in the same file,
    duplicating `start_minio()`'s purpose with a different tag-pinning
    strategy, and left it uncalled (dead code) — the second signature,
    **reopening the fallout window three minutes after #2725 (below)
    had briefly closed it**.

  **Reconciliation commits, reacting to the above collision rather than
  independently diagnosing the outage (2):**
  - **#2725** (`e2cd122`, an unrelated `autumn upgrade` codemod PR,
    sub-commit explicitly titled "fix: use the MINIO_IMAGE const **the
    merge from trunk-dev introduced**", 23:19:07Z): wired
    `avatar_s3_integration.rs`'s call site to #2743's constant, closing
    that file's dead-code gap — its own message names this as repairing
    merge-introduced dead code, not a fresh diagnosis. **This closes the
    first interval**: at this commit the whole tree is briefly
    dead-code-free (`offsite_backup.rs` had neither helper yet).
  - **#2756** (`a7c7c46`, 2026-09-13T02:09:18Z, 9h05 after #2740): removed
    the uncalled `minio_image()` from #2720, keeping `start_minio()`. Its
    own diff touches nothing but that deletion. **This closes the second
    interval, ending the fallout for good** — confirmed against the tree
    at this commit: `start_minio()` has two live callers, `MINIO_IMAGE` is
    wired into the avatar test, no unused helper remains. Zero dead code.

  **Later, unrelated to either the collision or its cleanup:**
  - **#2729** (`6e71bfb`, a large wire-contracts feature PR whose
    long-lived branch had merged `trunk-dev` in three times over the same
    window and picked up a MinIO fix each time, 2026-09-13T02:30:05Z, 21
    minutes *after* #2756 already closed the fallout): a subsequent
    refactor of the already-clean tree, not part of resolving the escape.
    It reintroduces and then re-collapses its own branch's separate
    `minio_image()` copy entirely within its own single squashed commit
    (`trunk-dev` itself never saw that intermediate duplicate state), and
    lands one clean genuine improvement as a side effect: a new
    regression test, `minio_image_pulls_from_the_public_registry` — a
    `#[test]` (not `#[ignore]`d, so it runs in the ordinary lane without
    Docker) asserting the descriptor's registry and that a tag is pinned,
    specifically so a future regression "surfaces as a red job naming a
    registry rather than the file that forgot" (its own doc comment).

  Confirmed directly against `autumn-cli/tests/integration/offsite_backup.rs`
  at `trunk-dev`'s current tip (`6e71bfb`, post-#2729's later refactor):
  `start_minio()` calls `minio_image()`, both tests call `start_minio()`,
  and `minio_image_pulls_from_the_public_registry` passes — one source of
  truth, no dead code, regression-guarded. This describes the current
  state, not the fallout's resolution point (#2756, above).
- **Impact, measured**: sampling `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs across the
  two disjoint fallout intervals — 2026-09-12T17:46:17Z (#2743, first
  dead-code seed) to 23:19:07Z (#2725, briefly clean), and 23:22:06Z
  (#2720, reopened) to 2026-09-13T02:09:18Z (#2756, clean for good) —
  roughly 8.3 hours combined — found the same `-D dead-code`
  `Lint` failure on 5 distinct, unrelated WIP branches (confirmed by job
  log inspection, not inferred from branch name): `claude/friendly-ritchie-uw76a2`,
  `claude/tender-galileo-6f3dr7`, `claude/epic-clarke-8nbaes`,
  `claude/brave-goldberg-gyr60j` (hit twice, both signatures below),
  `claude/busy-cerf-9zos9k`. (Separately, `fix/reddit-clone-minio-*` and
  `fix/minio-quay-registry` branch names were visible in the same window —
  those are other sessions' own outage-fix attempts, evidence of the
  coordination gap's scale, not additional dead-code victims, so they are
  not counted in this blast-radius figure.) Two distinct signatures, both
  dead-code, both in MinIO-related test files: `` error: function
  `minio_image` is never used `` (`autumn-cli/tests/integration/offsite_backup.rs:216`,
  from #2720's copy) and `` error: constant `MINIO_IMAGE` is never used ``
  (`examples/reddit-clone/tests/avatar_s3_integration.rs:22`, from #2743's
  unwired constant). Every hit failed only `Lint`/`Clippy` (and the `Test
  suite` aggregator that depends on it) — no runtime test behavior was
  affected, consistent with this being purely a merge-time dead-code
  artifact, not a functional regression.
- **Mechanism classification**: neither a test defect nor a product
  defect — a **process/coordination gap**, a four-way one for the
  original diagnoses plus two reactive cleanups, not a two-way one.
  Nothing in `ci.yml` or the repo's own tooling flags "another open PR
  already fixes this exact failure" before merge, and nothing flags
  "this branch's own dead code came from a trunk-dev merge, not from its
  own diff" either — so a failure visible to literally every open PR at
  once (Docker Hub removing a dependency image) drew independent,
  uncoordinated fixes from whichever PR happened to notice it first,
  including inside PRs whose own subject matter (a replay-guard test, a
  `SeqKey` ordering fix) had nothing to do with MinIO, and each collision
  between those fixes then needed its own separate reconciliation commit.
  No action needed here beyond recording it accurately: the fallout is
  already fully resolved on `trunk-dev`, with a regression test added
  later, and the affected branches only need an ordinary rebase to pick
  up the clean state. This is Tier 1 escape-analysis evidence per this
  role's own evidentiary tiers, not a new quarantine candidate.
- **Closed**: 2026-09-13 (🚦 Semaphore), recorded after the fact — the
  fallout resolved itself via the commits above before this pass began;
  corrected twice, same day (2026-09-13), after Codex review comments on
  the ledger's own PR (#2768) caught first the misattributed commits,
  then the wrong window end-point and the conflation of independent
  diagnoses with reactive cleanup commits.

### Escape: RUSTSEC-2026-0285 (rustls) failed the required `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` gate on any PR whose run reached the advisory audit with the pinned dependency, for ~7 hours, until fixed in passing by an unrelated PR

- **Not a flake, not a product bug — a real, externally-disclosed
  vulnerability, caught by the exact mechanism built to catch it.** RUSTSEC-2026-0285
  ("TLS 1.3 handshake messages incorrectly accepted across encryption level
  boundaries", `rustls` <0.23.45) landed in the advisory database sometime
  before 2026-09-14T16:15:15Z (the earliest observed failure this pass's
  sampling found — not confirmed as the true start, since the window before
  that wasn't re-sampled). `rustls 0.23.43` was pinned in the root
  `Cargo.lock`, pulled in transitively through `hyper-rustls`,
  `tokio-rustls`, `tonic`, `reqwest`, `redis`, `lettre`, and
  `tokio-postgres-rustls` — most of the workspace's own network stack, not
  one narrow edge — so `cargo-deny`'s advisory check failed the required
  `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` job on any open PR whose `Cargo.lock` carried
  that pin and whose `check-advisories.sh` run actually reached the audit
  step (carrying the pin was necessary but not sufficient — see the
  `validator-0.21.0` counterexample below, whose run carried the same pin
  but exited earlier on its own unrelated `fuzz/Cargo.lock` mismatch,
  never reaching the audit), independent of that PR's own diff otherwise.
  **Correction: not via the
  `test-gate`/`Test suite` aggregator** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s
  `test-gate.needs` is exactly `[test, trybuild, test-features,
  test-docker]` and does not include `supply-chain`, so a cargo-deny failure
  fails its own separate check, not that aggregator. It is still blocking in
  its own right: CONTRIBUTING.md's "Supply chain (cargo-deny)" section
  states plainly that the job is fully blocking ("a PR that introduces a new
  advisory... fails CI").
- **Mechanism classification**: unpinned/newly-disclosed external
  vulnerability data, the same structural shape as the MinIO/Docker-Hub
  outage above (a lockfile- or registry-level fact outside this repo's own
  diff failing every PR simultaneously), just triggered by a security
  advisory publishing instead of an image disappearing. Neither a test
  defect nor a product defect in this repo's own code.
- **Impact, measured**: 5 run-level `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` failures
  observed in the ~25.6h window sampled by the 2026-09-15 follow-up pass,
  spanning 2026-09-14T16:15:15Z–18:45:27Z (dependabot PRs opened before the
  bump landed would carry it too, but weren't separately confirmed beyond
  this window): `claude/compassionate-euler-hfl9hp` (16:15:15Z),
  `claude/epic-meitner-ftohjq` (17:51:24Z),
  `dependabot/github_actions/taiki-e/install-action-2.87.11` (18:35:30Z),
  `dependabot/cargo/rust-deps-8077afb676` (18:44:48Z), and
  `dependabot/cargo/diesel-ecosystem-1a91744208` (18:45:27Z). Two of the five
  (`compassionate-euler-hfl9hp`, `epic-meitner-ftohjq`) were confirmed by log
  content showing the advisory ID and `rustls 0.23.43` pin explicitly; the
  other three show the identical dependency-tree shape and identical
  `advisories FAILED` / exit-1 pattern, strongly consistent but not
  independently confirmed by the advisory-ID text (truncated out of the
  fetched tail). **Not universal**: run 34871417092
  (`claude/nifty-pascal-nebhrs`, 16:54:08Z, inside the failure window) passed
  `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` cleanly — whether a given PR hit this depended
  on whether its own `Cargo.lock` carried the exact `rustls 0.23.43` pin, not
  on every concurrently-open PR failing. `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0`'s
  own `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` failure in the same window (23:11:06Z) is a
  separate, pre-existing, unrelated `fuzz/Cargo.lock` `--locked` mismatch
  (already documented in the 2026-09-14 report), not this advisory.
- **Fix**: PR #2790 (`2acf14d`, merged 2026-09-14T23:07:59Z — ~6h53m after
  the earliest failure logged above), whose primary subject is an unrelated
  `examples/cms` editor UX fix, carries a second commit titled "fix: bump
  rustls to 0.23.45 to close RUSTSEC-2026-0285": `cargo update -p rustls
  --precise 0.23.45` (patch-level, no API break) against the root workspace
  `Cargo.lock`, plus a follow-up commit applying the identical bump to
  `fuzz/`'s own separate excluded-workspace `Cargo.lock` (cargo-deny's
  "satellite advisories" lane checks that lockfile independently and would
  not have been covered by the root bump alone). Root-caused via the
  advisory's own stated solution, not tolerance-widened or suppressed.
  **Found and fixed independent of this ledger's own tracking** — this entry
  records it after the fact, the same posture as the MinIO escape above —
  consistent with this repo's "red CI is work now" convention: whoever hit
  the failure on their own PR fixed it in place.
- **Verification**: CI-native, not just local — with one caveat. Every
  `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` run sampled that actually carried the updated
  lockfile passed: `dependabot/cargo/diesel-ecosystem` re-run at 23:11:34Z,
  `claude/compassionate-euler-hfl9hp` re-run at 23:19:49Z,
  `dependabot/cargo/rust-deps` re-run at 23:23:44Z. **Time alone is not the
  boundary**: `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0`'s own `Supply chain
  (cargo-deny)` job failed again at 23:11:06Z, after 23:07:59Z — but that
  failure is the separate, pre-existing `fuzz/Cargo.lock` `--locked`
  mismatch on a stale branch whose lockfile never picked up the rustls
  bump, not a recurrence of this advisory. Revert check: not
  applicable in the usual sense (nothing in this repo's own logic changed —
  the defect was an external vulnerability disclosure against a pinned
  version, not a bug in this repo's code), but the failure this fix removes
  is fully reproducible pre-fix (the five run IDs above) and specific to the
  `rustls` version pinned, not anything else in the check, so reverting the
  `Cargo.lock`/`fuzz/Cargo.lock` bump would reproduce the identical advisory
  failure immediately.
- **Closed**: 2026-09-15 (🚦 Semaphore), recorded after the fact — the
  outage resolved itself via PR #2790 (merged 2026-09-14T23:07:59Z) before
  this pass began sampling.

### `postgresql_embedded` build script: GitHub API rate limit (403) fetching release metadata

- **New, 2026-09-17.** First occurrence found in this pass. Run 35126796648
  (branch `claude/determined-bardeen-unefhv`, job `Test (Docker)`, completed
  2026-09-16T17:53Z; the triggering branch's diff has nothing to do with
  `postgresql_embedded` or Postgres tooling). `cargo build` failed compiling
  `postgresql_embedded v0.19.0`'s build script:
  `` error: failed to run custom build command for `postgresql_embedded v0.19.0` ``,
  stderr: `Error: HTTP status client error (403 rate limit exceeded) for url
  (https://api.github.com/repos/theseus-rs/postgresql-binaries/releases?page=1&per_page=100)`.
  This failed the required `Test suite` gate (via `test-docker`).
- **Mechanism**: unpinned/rate-limited external dependency — the crate's
  build script fetches PostgreSQL binary release metadata from GitHub's REST
  API unauthenticated (60 requests/hour per source IP), and GitHub Actions
  runners draw from a shared IP pool that many workflows across many repos
  hit simultaneously, so the limit can be exhausted by traffic this repo's
  own CI never generated. Structurally the same category as the closed
  MinIO/Docker-Hub and RUSTSEC-2026-0285 entries above (an external fact
  outside this repo's control failing the required gate independent of the
  triggering PR's own diff). **Unlike those two, this did not need a
  dozens-of-runs campaign to root-cause**: `ci.yml` itself already names
  and fixes this exact mechanism twice — the `coverage` job's own comment
  states it explicitly (`"postgresql_embedded's build script downloads
  Postgres binaries via the GitHub API; unauthenticated it hits the 60
  req/hr rate limit and fails the build with a 403. Authenticate with the
  job's token to get the higher rate limit."`, `GITHUB_TOKEN:
  ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` at job scope), and the Windows Tier 1 journey
  job's "the app builds on Windows" step carries the identical fix, citing
  the coverage job by name ("as the coverage job already does"). The
  `test-docker` job's "Run Docker-dependent tests" step — which builds
  `feature_flags_pg_integration` with the `managed-pg-bundled` feature, the
  same feature that pulls in `postgresql_embedded` — simply never got the
  same `env:` block added.
- **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2833): this
  is not feature-dependent or occasional exposure.** Read directly against
  `ci.yml`: `test-gate`'s `needs:` is `[test, trybuild, test-features,
  test-docker]`, unconditional, and `test-docker`'s "Run Docker-dependent
  tests" step is gated only on `runner.os == 'Linux'` (which
  `heavy_runs_on` always resolves to for `pull_request` events), not on any
  feature flag. So every PR reaching this required shard compiles
  `postgresql_embedded` unauthenticated until this fix — the exposure was
  universal on every PR, not merely n=1-and-hope-it-doesn't-recur.
- **Test-vs-product**: neither — pure CI/build infrastructure; no product
  code path is implicated.
- **Fix**: applied in this same PR (#2833) — added
  `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to `test-docker`'s "Run
  Docker-dependent tests" step, matching the `coverage` and Windows-journey
  jobs exactly, with a comment naming the 2026-09-16 run that hit this and
  pointing at the two existing instances of the same fix. Root-caused
  against the repo's own prior fixes for the identical mechanism, not a
  tolerance widening — nothing about the build's determinism changes, only
  whether the GitHub API call gets the 60/hour or 5,000/hour rate-limit
  tier.
- **Verification**: `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"` confirms
  the edited `ci.yml` is still valid YAML; `actionlint` was not available in
  this sandbox to run directly. No CI-native rerun of `test-docker` was
  captured before this entry was written (the failure this fixes is not a
  flake with a rate to measure — see Diagnosis in
  `docs/reports/2026-09-17-semaphore-ci-health-followup.md` — so there is no
  before/after rerun-rate table; the `coverage` job's own clean history since
  its identical fix landed is the closest available evidence that this
  pattern works). Revert check: not applicable in the rerun-campaign sense
  (nothing about test determinism changed), but reverting the added `env:`
  block would restore the exact unauthenticated call that produced the
  2026-09-16 403.
- **Status**: closed as fixed, 2026-09-17, #2833 (🚦 Semaphore).
- **Linked issue/PR**: none — the fix landed directly in this ledger's own
  tracking PR (#2833) rather than a separate issue, following this repo's
  "red CI is work now" convention once the mechanism was confirmed rather
  than merely hypothesized.

### `job_tracking_stores_integration::postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it`

- **New, 2026-09-11.** First occurrence found in the 2026-09-11 follow-up
  pass. Run 34517281816 (branch `vesper/bugbash-2634-spez-normalize-fallback`,
  not a change to the job-tracking code itself), job `Test (Docker)`
  (the bare `--ignored` sweep over the `autumn` consolidated
  `integration_tests` binary), 2026-09-10T19:24–20:01Z. `test result:
  FAILED. 369 passed; 1 failed` — a single failure among the whole Docker
  sweep. Panic at
  `autumn/tests/integration/job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:264:5`:
  `"record should be past its configured TTL"`.
- **Mechanism**: the test (lines 216-264) configures `ttl_secs: 1`, calls
  `job::enqueue_tracked` (which stamps `expires_at = self.clock.now() +
  1s` using the *application's* `SystemClock`,
  `PgJobTrackingStore::expires_at` in
  `autumn/src/job_tracking.rs:1874-1878`), reads the row back once, then
  `tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1_200))` before asserting
  `expires_at <= NOW()`, evaluated by Postgres
  (`autumn/tests/integration/job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:256-258`).
  `tokio::time::sleep` is `Instant`-backed and cannot fire early, so at
  least 1200ms of real host time elapses before the check — comfortably
  over the 1000ms TTL if `expires_at` is never rewritten after the initial
  enqueue.

  **Originally read (time dependence — dual clock source) as requiring
  Postgres's wall clock to lag the app host's by more than the ~200ms
  margin, attributed to contention on a heavily loaded runner.**
  **Correction (post-review, via a second Codex review comment on PR
  #2711): drop contention-induced clock skew as a candidate.** The Rust
  test process and its `testcontainers`-managed Postgres container run on
  the same GH Actions runner and, absent an explicit Linux time
  namespace (not configured here), read the same underlying
  `CLOCK_REALTIME` — they are not two independently-advancing clocks in
  the sense that framing implied. CPU scheduling contention can delay
  *when* a descheduled process gets to observe or write the clock, but
  that only ever adds real elapsed time before the observation happens; it
  cannot make the value read back *lag behind* true elapsed time, since
  both sides are reading the same clock. A genuine clock skew here would
  need a discrete step (e.g. an NTP correction moving the clock backward
  between the write and the check) rather than ordinary contention — a
  categorically different and far less likely mechanism, not the
  contention-driven one originally proposed. Demoted accordingly; not
  ruled out as a class (a clock step is possible in principle), but no
  longer treated as comparably likely to the mechanism below.

  **Correction (post-review, via a first Codex review comment on PR
  #2711): the "only way" framing was wrong regardless — a second,
  actually well-supported mechanism requires no clock disagreement at
  all.** `run_job_handler_inner` (`autumn/src/job.rs:2266-2286`) calls
  `store.mark_running(key)` immediately once the enqueued no-op job is
  picked up by the running job runtime this test starts, and on
  completion calls `ctx.settle_success()` (`autumn/src/job.rs:2346`); both
  route through `PgJobTrackingStore::update`
  (`autumn/src/job_tracking.rs:1927-1936`), which unconditionally
  rewrites `expires_at` to *that write's own* `now + ttl`, all on the same
  clock. If either write lands roughly 200-1000ms after the test's
  initial read — well within reach of ordinary worker dispatch latency,
  no contention or clock disagreement of any kind required —
  `expires_at` is pushed past the 1.2s check point legitimately. This is
  the same worker/update race the reviewer notes the Redis sibling test
  (lines 113-117 immediately above) also permits in principle, though no
  organic hit has been observed there — that sibling test is exposed to
  the same worker/update race but never crosses a second clock source, so
  it cannot help isolate the (now-demoted) clock-skew hypothesis, and its
  clean history so far says nothing about the worker-refresh one either
  way. **This worker-refresh mechanism is now the primary candidate**;
  neither it nor a discrete clock step is confirmed.
- **Test-vs-product**: not yet rendered, under either candidate mechanism.
  **Correction (post-review, via a fourth Codex review comment on PR
  #2711): "production never compares against Postgres's own `NOW()`" was
  flatly wrong — a separate production code path does exactly that,
  deliberately.** `pg_cleanup_expired_tracking_rows`
  (`autumn/src/job.rs:9333-9358`), run periodically off a
  `tracking_cleanup_interval.tick()`, executes `DELETE FROM
  autumn_job_tracking WHERE expires_at <= NOW()` — the same cross-process
  shape (an app-clock-stamped `expires_at` against Postgres's own `NOW()`)
  this test's assertion uses, and the codebase's own test comments
  (`autumn/src/job.rs:16704-16707`) already document the choice
  explicitly. So this test doesn't invent a comparison production never
  makes; it re-derives one production already makes elsewhere.
  **Correction (post-review, via a seventh Codex review comment on PR
  #2711): the sweep's cadence does not make ordinary clock disagreement
  immaterial to it, and the reasoning above was wrong to imply that.**
  Cadence controls how often the sweep gets a chance to observe a
  disagreement, not the disagreement's *size* at any one observation —
  a sweep that runs once every five minutes with the DB clock leading the
  app clock by, say, 50ms can delete a row `PgJobTrackingStore` still
  considers live just as readily as one that runs every second; running
  less often does not shrink the skew.
  **Correction (post-review, via an eighth Codex review comment on PR
  #2711): TTL length is not a bound on this risk either, and the previous
  fix's replacement reasoning repeated the same class of error.** A
  longer TTL moves the absolute expiry point further into the future; it
  does not widen any margin around that point, and a fixed clock
  disagreement (e.g. Postgres leading the stamping host by 50ms) shaves
  the same 50ms off the effective TTL whether it is 1 second or 24 hours.
  `JobTrackingConfig::ttl_secs` (`autumn/src/config.rs:3943-3966`) also has
  no enforced minimum — it is operator-configurable with a 24-hour
  default and nothing stopping a much smaller value — so "production TTLs
  are presumably chosen with margin" was an assumption, not a bound.
  Withdrawn along with the cadence reasoning it echoed: nothing in this
  entry actually bounds the early-deletion/late-retention risk from a
  real clock disagreement; it is retained as open, not quantified away.

  **Correction (post-review, via a ninth Codex review comment on PR
  #2711): the read path is not reliably same-clock either — that was true
  only for this specific test's single-process shape, not for production
  generally.** `docs/guide/jobs.md`'s "Web and worker process roles"
  section documents `web` and `worker` as separate process roles
  (typically separate replicas/hosts) that share one durable Postgres
  backend: a `web` replica's `job::enqueue_tracked` can stamp `expires_at`
  from its own `SystemClock`, while a different `worker` replica's
  `mark_running`/`settle_success` later calls
  `PgJobTrackingStore::update` (`autumn/src/job_tracking.rs:1896-1902`)
  using *that host's* `self.clock.now()` — genuinely two independent
  clocks in that supported topology, the same shape as the cleanup sweep,
  not a same-clock comparison at all. Only this test's own `combined`
  (single-process) shape makes it same-clock; a discrete clock step is
  not the only way the read path can disagree with an `expires_at` stamped
  elsewhere — ordinary inter-host skew across `web`/`worker` replicas can
  too, with no step required. `autumn/src/time.rs:105-108`'s point about
  wall-clock comparisons lacking a monotonic guarantee still applies and
  still matters for the single-host clock-step case, but it is no longer
  the only source of read-path risk. A backward host clock step between a
  write and a later read would extend a tracked job's effective TTL in
  production via this path too, not just in this test — a real,
  product-relevant characteristic of using wall-clock timestamps for TTL
  comparisons, not dismissible as a test artifact, and now understood to
  be one of at least two ways (clock step, or ordinary web/worker skew)
  this path's assumption can fail. None of this means the observed
  failure *was* a clock-related race of any kind — the worker-refresh
  mechanism above remains the better-supported explanation for this
  specific incident, since it fires within a single test process and
  needs no cross-host clock disagreement at all — only that the
  scenario's test-vs-product classification was wrong as originally
  written, repeatedly: once for
  treating the cross-process comparison itself as production-absent, and
  once for treating even a clock step as test-only. Refreshing
  `expires_at` on `mark_running`/`settle_success` (the
  worker-refresh hypothesis) is deliberate, sensible production behavior
  in its own right — a job still being worked on should not expire out
  from under it — so if that mechanism is the one actually firing here,
  the defect is squarely in the test's assumption that a fixed 1200ms
  sleep leaves no room for the tracked job's own worker to touch the
  record, not in the store: a test defect there. Both remain hypotheses
  from reading the source, not yet confirmed by a rerun campaign or an
  isolating experiment (e.g. asserting on `updated_at` to see which write,
  if either, actually fired), so treat the verdict as provisional per this
  role's own bar.
- **Status**: n=2 as of 2026-09-15 (see that dated update below) — escalated
  out of "n=1, not campaigned" per this entry's own stated trigger, a repeat
  signature. Not yet campaigned: a same-commit rerun-rate harness is
  recommended (see the 2026-09-15 update) but not yet built. Not
  quarantined — the Docker sweep is unmodified and this test keeps running
  on every sweep.
- **2026-09-13 update**: no repeat in the ~19h window sampled this pass
  (see the `live_upgrade` entry's dated update above for the window and
  method). Still n=1, still not campaigned.
- **2026-09-14 update**: no repeat in the ~23h window sampled this pass
  (see the `live_upgrade` entry's dated update above for the window and
  method). Still n=1, still not campaigned.
- **2026-09-15 update — n=1→n=2: a repeat, same exact signature, this
  entry's own stated escalation trigger.** Run 34934228774 (branch
  `claude/wizardly-wright-pkv2ly`, an unrelated AES-256-GCM cipher-cache PR,
  job `Test (Docker)`, completed 2026-09-15T07:08:43Z): `test result:
  FAILED. 378 passed; 1 failed` in the same consolidated `integration_tests`
  binary, panic at the identical site,
  `autumn/tests/integration/job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:264:5`:
  `"record should be past its configured TTL"` — same message, same line, as
  the 2026-09-11 first occurrence (run 34517281816). ~4 days apart, both
  organic, neither triggering PR touches job-tracking code. This does not by
  itself distinguish between the two candidate mechanisms already recorded
  above (demoted clock-step vs. the better-supported worker-refresh race);
  it only confirms the signature repeats, which is exactly the condition
  this entry names for moving out of "n=1, not campaigned." **Recommendation
  (2026-09-15-semaphore-ci-health-followup.md)**: a dedicated rerun harness
  — ≥20 iterations of `postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it`
  alone against a real testcontainers Postgres — is needed to get a
  same-commit rerun-rate baseline before any fix is attempted; unlike the
  macOS cluster this doesn't need a human-gated CI-spend decision, since it's
  already a Docker-Postgres test running in the existing sweep and can be
  reran locally with the repo's own tooling. Not built this pass. Still not
  campaigned — n=2 organic is a trigger for escalation, not a rerun-rate
  measurement in its own right.
- **2026-09-17 update**: no repeat in the ~24.3h window sampled this pass
  (see the `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-17 dated update above for the
  window and method). Still n=2, still not campaigned.
- **2026-09-18 update — the recommended rerun harness is built, not yet
  dispatchable.** No repeat in the ~21.6h window sampled this pass (see the
  `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-18 dated update above for the window and
  method). Still n=2 organic, still no rerun-rate baseline. This pass adds
  `.github/workflows/manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml`: a `workflow_dispatch`
  harness that builds the `autumn-web` `integration_tests` binary once
  (`--features "test-support,offline-sync,ws,mail,redis,i18n,collab"`,
  matching `ci.yml`'s `test-docker` job exactly) and then reruns just
  `integration::job_tracking_stores_integration::postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it`
  20 or 50 times in a loop against a fresh testcontainers Postgres container
  each iteration, logging each iteration's pass/fail to its own uploaded
  artifact. Unlike `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`, this needs no new
  runner class or CI spend to justify a human sign-off — it's the same
  ordinary `ubuntu-latest` + Docker shape `test-docker` already runs on every
  PR, just isolated to one test and looped — so the intent is to dispatch it
  as a matter of routine CI-health work, not as a spend decision.

  **Built this pass, but not dispatchable this pass**: `workflow_dispatch`
  only accepts a workflow that already exists on the repository's *default*
  branch (`trunk-dev`), even when the dispatch targets a different `ref` —
  confirmed directly by attempting the dispatch against this harness's own
  authoring branch and getting `404 Not Found` from the
  `actions/workflows/{id}/dispatches` endpoint. This is the identical gotcha
  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml` hit: that harness "only became
  dispatchable... when #2627 fixed its parse error" landed on `trunk-dev`,
  per this ledger's own `live_upgrade` entry. **Next step, for whichever pass
  finds this PR merged**: dispatch
  `manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml` with `iterations: "50"` (the low-rate
  side of this role's own ≥20/≥50 split — n=2 organic in roughly two weeks of
  ambient PR traffic is well under 10%) against `trunk-dev`'s tip, then fold
  the resulting `k/50` into this entry and, if `k` is nonzero, pull the failing
  iterations' logs to check which of the two candidate mechanisms (demoted
  clock-step vs. the better-supported worker-refresh race) actually fired —
  each iteration's log is uploaded individually so a failing one doesn't get
  lost in a combined tail.
- **2026-09-20 update — Tier 1 baseline obtained: 1/50 (2%), same signature;
  mechanism confirmed by source, not just hypothesis; deterministic fix
  proposed in this pass's own PR.** `manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml` (PR
  #2845, merged 2026-09-18T15:50Z) was dispatched twice against `trunk-dev`'s
  tip that same day, both by the time this pass started, neither previously
  folded into this entry: run 35364903427 failed at the checkout step (a bad
  `sha` input, `dd664e8e21be34beddd5f9b27280fde1d86ab6d2` — 41 hex characters,
  one too many — so `actions/checkout` never ran the test loop; 0 iterations
  executed, not a data point). Run 35365077413, dispatched two minutes later
  with a corrected `sha`, completed successfully end to end: **`RESULT: 1/50
  failed, 49/50 passed`**. This is this entry's first same-commit Tier 1
  rerun-rate baseline, superseding "n=2 organic, not yet campaigned."

  The one failure, iteration 26 (log fetched via `get_job_logs` on job
  105665441315), is the identical signature already tracked: panic
  `"record should be past its configured TTL"` at
  `autumn/tests/integration/job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:264:5`, inside
  a fresh testcontainers Postgres container built for that iteration alone —
  confirming the flake is reproducible in isolation, not an artifact of
  running inside the full `integration_tests` binary alongside 2000+ other
  tests.

  **Mechanism, now confirmed by direct source reading rather than left as a
  hypothesis**: `PgJobTrackingStore::update` (`autumn/src/job_tracking.rs`,
  the `update` method) unconditionally executes
  `UPDATE autumn_job_tracking SET record = ..., updated_at = $3, expires_at =
  $4 WHERE key = $1` with `expires_at = self.expires_at(now) = now +
  ttl_secs` on **every** call — both `mark_running` (called once the job
  runtime picks up the enqueued job) and `settle_success` (called on
  completion) route through it unconditionally, with no guard against
  refreshing a record whose TTL clock the test has already started. This is
  exactly the "worker-refresh" mechanism this entry already named as the
  better-supported candidate; reading the store's own `update` method
  directly (rather than reasoning about it secondhand) removes the
  "hypothesis" qualifier the prior entries carried. The demoted clock-step
  candidate remains structurally possible but is not needed to explain this
  occurrence and was not separately re-investigated this pass.

  **Test-vs-product verdict, rendered**: test defect, not a product defect.
  Refreshing `expires_at` on every lifecycle write is deliberate, correct
  store behavior — a job still being worked on should not expire out from
  under it, the same conclusion this entry already reached when the
  mechanism was still a hypothesis. The test's fixed
  `tokio::time::sleep(1_200ms)`, measured from the enqueue-time read, assumes
  nothing else touches the record before the sleep elapses; that assumption
  is false whenever the runtime's own job dispatch (`mark_running` and/or
  `settle_success`) lands inside that 1200ms window, which is a matter of
  ordinary scheduling latency, not a race in the store.

  **Fix, applied in this pass's own PR**: replaced the fixed sleep with a
  poll loop (50ms interval, 5s deadline) that reads the tracked record back
  and waits for `status` to reach a terminal value (`"succeeded"` or
  `"failed"`) before starting the TTL sleep. Once the job reaches a terminal
  status, `mark_running`/`settle_success` have made their last write for that
  key (confirmed via `run_job_handler_inner` in `autumn/src/job.rs`: exactly
  one `mark_running` call, one settle call, `max_attempts: 1` on the `noop`
  job used here, no retry path), so nothing further touches `expires_at` and
  the subsequent 1200ms sleep is racing nothing. This awaits the actual
  condition (job completion) instead of guessing a sleep duration long enough
  to usually outrun an unbounded dispatch latency — the fix this role's own
  process always prefers over a raised timeout. The Redis sibling test
  (lines 45-117) has the identical race in principle (its own TTL is set by
  the backend on write, refreshed on every `update` call the same way) but no
  organic hit has ever been recorded against it, so it was left unchanged
  this pass rather than preemptively rewritten on no evidence of its own.

  **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2867): the
  poll-for-terminal fix as first written replaced the race with a second,
  load-dependent flake of its own.** `PgJobTrackingStore::update`'s own
  `WHERE key = $1 AND expires_at > $2` guard means a lifecycle write is
  silently a no-op once the row is already expired — so at the original
  `ttl_secs: 1`, a `mark_running`/`settle_success` write delayed past one
  second by ordinary Docker-CI-runner scheduler or database contention would
  find its own write vetoed, `status` would stay `"pending"` forever, and
  the poll loop would spin to its 5s deadline and panic — a scenario in
  which the *original* fixed-sleep version would have passed. Caught on
  review before this ever ran organically or through another rerun
  campaign, not discovered empirically. Fixed by two changes together:
  `ttl_secs` raised from 1 to 10 (comfortable margin over any realistic
  in-process job-dispatch delay, so the write-guard is no longer plausibly
  in the poll loop's way) with the poll deadline correspondingly capped at
  8s (leaving margin under the TTL rather than racing it from the other
  side); and the post-terminal wait no longer sleeps a fixed guess at all —
  it queries `GREATEST(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (expires_at - NOW())), 0)` on the
  row directly and sleeps exactly that plus a 300ms margin, so it is correct
  regardless of how much of the 10s TTL the completion wait already
  consumed, rather than assuming a fixed 1200ms is always enough. `cargo
  check`/`cargo clippy -D warnings` clean against the `integration_tests`
  target after this revision (same command as below, re-run).

  **Verification status — not yet closed.** No Docker daemon is available in
  this sandbox (confirmed: `docker ps` fails to reach
  `/var/run/docker.sock`), so the fix could not be exercised against a real
  Postgres container locally. Local verification obtained this pass, on
  both the original and the corrected version of the fix: `cargo check -p
  autumn-web --features "test-support,offline-sync,ws,mail,redis,i18n,collab"
  --test integration_tests` (clean, exit 0) and `cargo clippy` with the same
  package/features/target plus `-- -D warnings` (clean, exit 0 — the only
  warning printed is a pre-existing, unrelated `unknown lint:
  clippy::unused_async_trait_impl` also seen on unrelated builds, not
  introduced by this change). Neither exercises the container/timing path a
  real rerun would. Per this role's
  own bar, an after-measurement (0/N on the same harness) is required before
  this entry closes, and that needs the fix merged to `trunk-dev` first
  (`manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only and —
  per the 2026-09-18 update above — only dispatchable against a workflow
  already registered on the default branch). **Next step, for whichever pass
  finds this PR merged**: dispatch `manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml` with
  `iterations: "50"` again against `trunk-dev`'s new tip; 0/50 closes this
  entry per the intake form above (the revert check for this fix is
  structural, not a second rerun campaign: reverting the poll loop restores
  the exact fixed-sleep race the 1/50 result above already reproduced, so a
  clean 0/50 after the fix is itself the before/after comparison this role's
  process calls for).

  **Closed, 2026-09-20 (later the same day), 🚦 Semaphore.** PR #2867 merged
  (`0a0986b`). Dispatched `manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml` with
  `iterations: "50"` against `trunk-dev`'s new tip (run 35533143158) as the
  next step above specified. First dispatch attempt (run 35532835018) failed
  at checkout — passed the merge commit as an abbreviated 7-character SHA
  (`0a0986b`), which `actions/checkout`'s `+refs/heads/<sha>*:...` fetch
  pattern treats as a ref-name glob, not a commit; needs the full 40-character
  SHA. Redispatched with the full SHA
  (`0a0986b3b862ebf49097a359fe1e25e3d3ecb355`); ran clean end to end: build
  7m05s, then the 50-iteration loop 10m13s (individual iterations now take
  ~2-12s each rather than ~2.5s, since the fix's own poll-for-terminal step
  and remaining-TTL sleep add real wall-clock time when they have to wait —
  expected, not a regression). **`RESULT: 0/50 failed, 50/50 passed`** — the
  after-measurement this role's own bar requires, from the same harness, same
  same-commit protocol, as the 1/50 baseline above. Revert check per this
  entry's own framing above (structural, not a second campaign): the 1/50
  result already reproduces the pre-fix race on iteration 26 of that run, so
  this clean 0/50 on the merged fix is the completing half of that
  before/after pair.

  **Scope of this closure — corrected (post-review, via a Codex review
  comment on PR #2874): closing this entry closes the CI flake, not the
  broader clock-comparison question the entry's own analysis raised.** The
  0/50 result exercises the fixed, single-process test only — it confirms
  the *worker-refresh* mechanism (the same clock, `mark_running`/
  `settle_success` refreshing `expires_at` inside the test's own sleep
  window) was iteration 26's cause and that this test no longer races it.
  It says nothing about, and does not test, the separate risk the
  2026-09-11 update's ninth correction (above) already flagged and left
  explicitly unresolved: a `web`/`worker` split-replica deployment
  compares `expires_at` (stamped by one host's clock) against Postgres's
  `NOW()` or another host's clock, and nothing in this codebase bounds
  that skew. That risk was never confirmed as the cause of *any* observed
  failure (the two organic hits and the 1/50 CI-native failure are all
  now attributed to the single-process worker-refresh mechanism), so it
  does not block closing *this* flake — but closing the flake must not
  read as resolving it too. Filed as its own tracked item, issue #2875,
  so it has a durable home now that this entry moves to "Closed entries"
  and stops being sampled daily.

  With that scope correction: entry closed for the CI flake specifically —
  rerun-rate baseline established (1/50 → 0/50), mechanism confirmed by
  source (not hypothesis), test-vs-product verdict rendered for *this*
  failure (test defect, single-process worker-refresh race), fix applied
  and CI-natively verified twice over (PR #2867's own `Test (Docker)` run,
  plus this dedicated 50-iteration harness), ledger and reports updated
  throughout, review findings from three Codex review passes across two
  PRs addressed and resolved before merge. The cross-host clock-skew
  question is separately tracked in issue #2875, not closed by this entry.

  This pass's organic-hit sampling (2026-09-18T07:33:38Z exclusive to
  2026-09-20T07:33:19Z, ~72h, two `perPage=100` pages, 200 runs: 143
  cancelled/47 success/10 failure) found zero new organic hits on
  `job_tracking_stores_integration` or any of the three `live_upgrade`
  signatures/`cache_stampede`/`sim_fault_plan`. Of the 10 run-level failures:
  2 predate this window (already counted in the 2026-09-18 report); 2 are
  `dependabot/github_actions/dtolnay/rust-toolchain-1.120.0`'s own action-pin
  bump breaking `MSRV (1.88.0)` and all three `Test (${{ matrix.os }})` jobs
  on that same branch — squarely that PR's own subject matter, not merged so
  not affecting anyone else's CI; 2 are `vesper/bugbash-2828-intentional-root`
  and `claude/project-thread-bk4ejy`, each its own branch's `Clippy` failure
  (the latter also failing `SQLite runtime`'s own clippy step) — ordinary WIP,
  not re-triaged past job level given the pattern is already well-established
  in this ledger; 1 is `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0` repeating its
  already-documented `fuzz/Cargo.lock` staleness; 1 is
  `vesper/macro-crate-split` repeating its already-documented
  in-progress-refactor multi-job break; `claude/stop-changelog-conflicts-0xp5f8`
  and `claude/intelligent-wright-ebjkn4` were not individually triaged this
  pass (time-boxed in favor of following through on the job_tracking result
  above) — noted as a gap rather than silently assumed branch-owned.
  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-20T~10:0xZ — **12th** straight
  pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now ~283 hours
  idle, past 11.5 days). Dispatching it needs a human sign-off for new macOS
  CI spend per this role's own rules; not dispatched this pass for that
  reason, flagged again rather than silently carried.

### `crate_path::tests::resolve_autumn_web_name_dashed_rename_is_sanitized`

- **2026-09-22 update — root cause confirmed by reading `proc_macro_crate`
  3.5.0's own source (not left as a hypothesis), deterministic fix applied
  and verified with a purpose-built stress harness, committed as a permanent
  regression test.** This pass's organic-hit sampling (2026-09-21T09:55:07Z
  exclusive to 2026-09-22T06:24:50Z, ~20.5h, one `perPage=100`/`page=1` query
  whose own span, 2026-09-20T21:36:26Z–2026-09-22T06:24:50Z, fully covered
  the window — 60 `pull_request`-triggered `ci.yml` runs: 42 cancelled/12
  success/6 failure) found zero repeats of this signature, but with network
  and a Rust toolchain available in this pass's own sandbox (unlike prior
  passes), the 2026-09-21 entry's own recommended next step —
  `cargo test -p autumn-macros-support crate_path:: -- --test-threads=<N>`
  — was followed through on directly rather than deferred again.
- **The prior entry's leading hypothesis (a `proc_macro_crate` caching or
  locking gap) does not hold up against the crate's actual source.** Read
  `proc-macro-crate-3.5.0/src/lib.rs` directly (fetched via `cargo check`,
  vendored under `~/.cargo/registry/src/`): its internal cache is keyed by
  the literal `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` string plus `Cargo.toml`'s own mtime, and
  `crate_name`'s only external-process interaction
  (`cargo locate-project --workspace --manifest-path=<fixture path>`) is
  spawned with an explicit `--manifest-path`, not by reading the env var a
  second time — so this crate's own cache is not the mechanism.
- **The actual mechanism is in this repo's own test helper, not the
  dependency.** `with_fixture_manifest` (`autumn-macros-support/src/crate_path.rs`,
  then lines 621-627) calls `tempfile_dir()` and `std::fs::write`s the
  fixture `Cargo.toml` to it **before** entering `temp_env::with_var`'s
  serializing lock — so two of this module's four `with_fixture_manifest`
  tests (which `cargo test` runs concurrently by default) racing to the same
  directory name would race their `fs::write` calls unprotected, and
  whichever test read second would see the *other* test's fixture content.
  `tempfile_dir()`'s uniqueness came entirely from
  `format!("...{}-{:?}", process::id(), SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_nanos())`
  — since every test in one `cargo test` binary shares one `pid`, all
  uniqueness rested on the nanosecond timestamp being different across two
  concurrent threads, which is not guaranteed at whatever resolution the
  platform's clock actually offers under contention. The one organic hit
  (2026-09-21, `Test (macos-latest)`, `left: "autumn_web", right:
  "autumn_web_05"`) is exactly consistent with this: `"autumn_web"` is
  `DEFAULT_NAME`, the fallback `resolve_autumn_web_name_falls_back_when_dependency_absent`'s
  own fixture (which declares no `autumn-web` dependency at all) would
  produce — i.e. the dashed-rename test very plausibly read a sibling test's
  colliding fixture rather than its own.
- **Measured, not assumed — a Tier 1 controlled-variable stress harness,
  before and after.** A standalone Rust program mirroring `tempfile_dir()`'s
  exact naming formula, run from 64 threads × 2,000 iterations each
  (128,000 samples/run) on this sandbox's own (Linux) hardware, found a
  real, repeatable collision rate in the pre-fix scheme: **158/768,000
  (~0.021%) across 6 runs** (26, 32, 29, 38, 33, 27 collisions per run) —
  non-zero on ordinary Linux hardware despite the one organic hit landing on
  macOS, where clock resolution under contention is plausibly coarser
  still. This is exactly the class of evidence this role's own bar calls
  "Tier 1 — Controlled-variable runs": a fixed, reproducible protocol
  isolating the one variable (clock-based vs. counter-based naming) that
  changes the verdict.
- **Test-vs-product verdict, rendered first, before touching the fix**:
  test defect, not a product defect. `tempfile_dir()` is a private helper
  inside `autumn-macros-support`'s own `#[cfg(test)]` module, used by
  exactly the four tests in this file (confirmed by grep — no other module
  calls it); no production macro-expansion path or downstream crate is
  affected. `resolve_autumn_web_name`'s own real behavior — and the
  `proc_macro_crate` dependency it calls — were never implicated.
- **Fix, root-caused not tolerance-widened**: replaced the timestamp with a
  process-wide monotonic `AtomicU64` counter (`unique_fixture_dir_name`,
  same file) — a counter can never repeat within a process regardless of
  clock resolution, eliminating the race by construction rather than
  narrowing its window. No sleep, retry, or timeout was added anywhere.
- **Verification — 0/N after, from the same harness, plus a real revert
  check (not just the structural kind other entries have had to settle
  for).** Because this mechanism is deterministic and local (no Docker, no
  network flake to wait out), the fix could be verified far more directly
  than most entries in this ledger:
  - The 6-run, 128,000-sample-per-run stress harness above re-run against
    the fixed (counter-based) scheme: **0/768,000 collisions**, all 6 runs.
  - The same naming logic was committed as a permanent, fast (no filesystem
    I/O), deterministic regression test —
    `crate_path::tests::unique_fixture_dir_name_never_collides_under_concurrency`
    (64 threads × 2,000 iterations, asserting no two generated names
    collide) — added directly to `autumn-macros-support/src/crate_path.rs`
    alongside the fix, so this failure mode is now guarded by ordinary
    `cargo test`, not left to the Docker/macOS sweep's luck.
  - **Revert check, run for real, not inferred structurally**: temporarily
    restored the old timestamp-based `unique_fixture_dir_name()` (keeping
    the new test) and ran
    `cargo test -p autumn-macros-support --release crate_path::tests::unique_fixture_dir_name_never_collides_under_concurrency -- --exact`
    15 times: **15/15 FAILED** (release mode's tighter loop makes the
    collision far more probable than the ~0.02% debug-mode rate above — this
    is expected, not a discrepancy, since tighter timing windows between
    concurrent `SystemTime::now()` reads increase collision odds). Restored
    the fix and re-ran the identical 15 invocations: **15/15 passed**. Both
    `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -p autumn-macros-support
    --all-targets -- -D warnings` are clean (the sole warning present,
    `unknown lint: clippy::unused_async_trait_impl`, is the same pre-existing,
    unrelated warning already documented elsewhere in this ledger).
    `cargo test -p autumn-macros-support` (full package, 40 tests) passes.
- **Closed**, 2026-09-22, #2895 (🚦 Semaphore).

### `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e::sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably`

- **New, 2026-09-21.** Two organic hits in the ~26.4h window sampled this
  pass, both on the `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)` job, both the identical
  panic:
  ```
  tracked enqueue: AutumnError { status: 500, inner: StringError("sqlite job
  enqueue failed: ON CONFLICT clause does not match any PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE
  constraint"), ... }
  ```
  at `autumn/tests/sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e.rs:1301:6`.
  - Run 106158118450 (run 35540844428, branch `claude/friendly-ritchie-d36hku`,
    PR #2842 "Folio: make Autumn's log settings findable" — **docs-only**, "0
    pages added" by its own title, merged as `4a448ab`), 2026-09-20T22:20:48Z.
  - Run 106110875320 (run 35523247491, branch
    `claude/macro-split-decomposition-jalk90`, an in-progress
    autumn-macros crate-split/rename branch, no open PR),
    2026-09-20T16:50:08Z.
- **Not branch-owned**: PR #2842 is a pure docs change (confirmed by its own
  title/scope) touching no job or SQLite code, yet hit the byte-identical
  failure as an unrelated in-progress refactor branch. That rules out either
  branch's own diff as the cause and points at a pre-existing race in
  `trunk-dev` itself (in the product code, the test, or both) rather than WIP.
- **Mechanism — confirmed source location, unconfirmed cause.** The panic
  originates in `SqliteJobBackend`'s enqueue path
  (`autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs:429-432`): the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (name,
  unique_key) WHERE unique_key IS NOT NULL AND status IN ('enqueued',
  'running') DO NOTHING` targets a **partial unique index** unconditionally,
  for every job — including this test's `sqlite_tracked_job`, which declares
  no `JobUniqueness` at all. SQLite requires an `ON CONFLICT` target to match
  an existing index's column list AND partial-index predicate exactly; this
  specific error text is what SQLite raises on a target/index *mismatch*, not
  on a duplicate-value constraint violation — i.e. the index this clause
  expects did not exist, in the expected shape, on this connection at
  execution time.

  **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2883): the
  original version of this entry's leading hypothesis — a readiness race
  between the fresh per-test SQLite pool's migrations and
  `start_runtime`/`enqueue_tracked` being able to submit work before that
  migration completed — is wrong, and contradicted by the queue path itself,
  not merely unconfirmed.** `enqueue_job_at` (`autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs:391`)
  calls `let pool = queue_handle.ready().await?;` *before* obtaining a
  connection or executing the insert. `SqliteJobQueue::ready`
  (`autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs:253-258`) awaits
  `self.schema.get_or_try_init(|| ensure_schema(&self.pool))` — a
  `tokio::sync::OnceCell` — and `ensure_schema`
  (`autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs:269-305`) is what creates
  `idx_autumn_jobs_unique_inflight`, the exact partial unique index this
  clause's `ON CONFLICT (name, unique_key) WHERE unique_key IS NOT NULL AND
  status IN ('enqueued', 'running')` target names, via a synchronously
  awaited `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`. Read and confirmed directly
  against `autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs` (not taken on the reviewer's word
  alone): every enqueue through this queue handle awaits schema creation
  first, so an enqueue cannot structurally overtake it. **This rules out
  migration/readiness ordering as the mechanism, not just leaves it
  unconfirmed.** The actual cause is open again — candidates not yet
  investigated include a second insert code path that doesn't route through
  `ready()`, a SQLite-version-specific quirk in how the partial-index
  predicate is matched against the `ON CONFLICT` target, or a stale/reused
  database file — but none of these has been checked against source or a
  reproduction yet.

  **Ruled out**: cross-test interference via the process-global
  `GLOBAL_JOB_CLIENT` this test depends on
  (`autumn_web::job_tracking::enqueue_tracked` routes through
  `job::global_job_client()`, per `autumn/src/job_tracking.rs:1134`). Checked
  every test in this same file (`sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e.rs`) that calls
  `job::start_runtime`: all of them hold `global_job_runtime_test_lock()`
  first. The tests that do *not* hold that lock
  (`in_process_scheduler_coordinator_fires_a_task_on_sqlite`,
  `distributed_lock_*_on_sqlite`, `sqlite_scheduler_lease_*`,
  `sqlite_tracking_store_*`) build their own scoped coordinator/lock/store
  instances against their own local `pool`, never `start_runtime` or the
  global client — so they do not appear able to race this test's global-state
  window. Not exhaustively verified across every other file that might
  compile into the same `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)` job's test
  binaries, but no interference path found within this file.
- **Test-vs-product verdict: not yet rendered.** The readiness-gap framing
  above is now ruled out (schema creation is synchronously awaited ahead of
  every enqueue), so the open candidates — a second, unaudited enqueue path
  that bypasses `ready()`; a SQLite-version-specific `ON CONFLICT`
  partial-index matching quirk; a stale/reused database file — have not yet
  been sorted into test-defect vs. product-defect. Undetermined.
- **Not campaigned, no fix PR**: n=2, no Tier 1 rerun-rate baseline — this
  role's hard gate does not permit a fix PR on this evidence alone, and the
  mechanism itself is now back to unconfirmed after the correction above.
  Next step: a same-commit rerun harness for this test against the
  `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)` feature set (same pattern as
  `.github/workflows/manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml`) to reproduce it
  on demand, since source-reading alone has now ruled out one hypothesis
  without surfacing a replacement.
- **Does not appear to have blocked either PR**: #2842 merged
  (`4a448ab`); whether that specific failing run was superseded by a later
  green rerun on the same PR, or `SQLite runtime` wasn't a required check at
  merge time, was not independently confirmed this pass — out of scope for
  today's time-boxed triage.
- **2026-09-22 update — no repeat in the ~20.5h window sampled this pass**
  (see the `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-22 dated update above for the
  window and method) — still n=2, still not campaigned via CI-native means.
  This pass adds `.github/workflows/manual-sqlite-jobs-rerun-check.yml`, the
  next step the 2026-09-21 entry called for: a `workflow_dispatch` harness
  mirroring `manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml`'s shape (build once, loop
  N times), building the standalone `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e` `[[test]]`
  target under the same `--features "sqlite,test-support,storage"` `ci.yml`'s
  `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)` job uses (its "Run the sqlite integration
  suite" step), then looping
  `sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably` alone against a fresh
  on-disk SQLite file per iteration. Like the `job_tracking` harness before
  it, this needs no runner class or CI spend a human must sign off on — it
  is the same `ubuntu-latest`, no-Docker shape `ci.yml` already runs on
  every PR, just isolated to one test and looped — so it is not gated the
  way `manual-macos-contention-check.yml` is. **Built this pass, not
  dispatchable via `workflow_dispatch` this pass**: that API only accepts a
  workflow already present on the repository's default branch (`trunk-dev`),
  the identical gotcha the `job_tracking` and `macos` harnesses both hit
  before their own merges (see their entries above).

  **This pass's own sandbox had a working Rust toolchain and network access
  (unlike several prior passes), so the harness's exact protocol was run
  locally rather than left waiting on a merge**: `cargo test -p autumn-web
  --features "sqlite,test-support,storage" --test sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e
  -- --test-threads=1 sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably`, looped
  50 times against a fresh on-disk SQLite file per iteration (the harness
  workflow's own loop, run by hand). **Result: `0/50` failed, `50/50`
  passed** — no repro in this sample. Confirmed via the root `Cargo.toml`
  (`libsqlite3-sys = { version = "0.38", features = ["bundled"] }`): this
  repo compiles its own vendored SQLite amalgamation rather than linking the
  host's system library, so the SQLite binary itself should be equivalent
  between this sandbox and GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` runners — the OS/kernel
  scheduling environment around it is the remaining unconfirmed variable.
  **This does not close the entry
  and should not be read as evidence the mechanism is gone**: n=2 organic
  in roughly a day of ambient PR traffic is a low enough rate that P(0
  failures in 50 independent trials) stays uncomfortably high even if the
  true rate is ~1-2% (≈0.6–0.9 under a naive binomial model) — a single
  50-run miss is exactly what a low-rate flake looks like most of the time,
  not evidence it was a one-off. Recorded as a data point, not a baseline:
  the true Tier 1 baseline still needs either a CI-native dispatch once this
  harness reaches `trunk-dev`, or a substantially larger local sample (e.g.
  200+) to meaningfully narrow the "still present at low rate" vs. "was
  never reproducible outside the original two CI runs" question.
  **Next step, for whichever pass finds this PR merged**: dispatch
  `manual-sqlite-jobs-rerun-check.yml` with `iterations: "50"` against
  `trunk-dev`'s tip (CI-native, not local) — or, if a future pass again has
  working local toolchain/network access and wants a higher-confidence
  negative before that, extend the local sample well past 50 first.
- **2026-09-22, later the same day — CI-native Tier 1 baseline obtained: 0/50
  (0%), same day PR #2895 merged.** `manual-sqlite-jobs-rerun-check.yml` was
  dispatched against `trunk-dev`'s new tip (`85ce096`, PR #2895's merge
  commit) as soon as it became available (`workflow_dispatch` only accepts a
  workflow already on the default branch). Run 35752555923 completed clean
  end to end in under 4 minutes total (build 2m44s, then all 50 iterations in
  22 seconds — this test needs no container startup, unlike the Postgres-backed
  `job_tracking` harness, so it is far cheaper to run at high sample counts).
  **`RESULT: 0/50 failed, 50/50 passed`** — the CI-native baseline the
  2026-09-21 entry's own next step called for. Combined with this same day's
  local 0/50 run above, that is **0/100 clean reruns total**, none of them
  reproducing the "ON CONFLICT clause does not match" panic.

  **Still not closing this entry.** Per this role's own hard gate, a Tier 1
  baseline this clean would ordinarily support closing a *diagnosed and
  fixed* flake — but nothing has been fixed here: the mechanism is still
  unconfirmed, and there is no product-vs-test verdict to render. **Correction
  (post-review, via a third Codex review comment on PR #2904): drop "a
  second, unaudited SQLite `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` path" as a candidate —
  it does not exist.** `grep -rn "sqlite job enqueue failed"` across the
  whole repo finds exactly one call site
  (`autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs:461`), immediately after the file's sole
  `INSERT INTO autumn_jobs ... ON CONFLICT` (lines 428-458), and that
  function unconditionally awaits `queue_handle.ready()` first
  (`sqlite.rs:392`) — the same readiness-gate call already confirmed above
  to create the partial index before any insert. There is no second path to
  audit; the only remaining named candidate is the SQLite-version-specific
  partial-index matching quirk. 0/100 with no fix
  applied does not mean the bug is gone; it means same-commit reruns of this
  one test, run the way this harness runs it, have not reproduced it.

  **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2904): the
  original version of this update named the wrong structural difference —
  "sibling CI jobs competing for the same runner" is not how GitHub Actions
  works, and this repo's own docs already say so.** `AGENTS.md`
  (`AGENTS.md:83-86`) states plainly, of a sibling job in this same
  workflow: "a runner whose disk it is the only claimant of" — each `ci.yml`
  job (`Lint`, `MSRV`, `SQLite runtime`, etc.) gets its own dedicated,
  isolated GitHub-hosted VM, not a shared host with other concurrently
  running jobs. There is no cross-job disk/CPU contention for this harness's
  isolation to structurally rule out; that framing was wrong, not merely
  unconfirmed.

  **The actual, verifiable structural difference is same-binary test
  parallelism, not job isolation.** `ci.yml`'s own "Run the sqlite
  integration suite" step (the real organic path both hits occurred on)
  invokes `cargo test -p autumn-web --features "sqlite,test-support,storage"
  --test sqlite_boot_serve --test sqlite_migrations ... --test
  sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e --test confidential_repository_bidx ...` — no
  `--test-threads` flag anywhere in that step, so libtest runs every test
  *within* the `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e` binary (27 tests total, per this
  binary's own test count) at its default parallelism, one OS thread per
  logical core. `manual-sqlite-jobs-rerun-check.yml`'s loop, by contrast,
  filters to the single target test name **and** passes `--test-threads=1`
  explicitly — eliminating same-binary concurrency entirely, not just
  cross-job concurrency. If the real mechanism is a race between
  `sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably` and one of its 26 sibling
  tests in the same file (shared process-global state, a shared on-disk
  path, or contention on some other resource within the same test binary),
  this harness's `--test-threads=1` filter would structurally prevent it
  from ever reproducing, exactly the same shape of gap the withdrawn
  sibling-job framing was reaching for, just at the correct layer (one test
  binary's own internal parallelism, not GitHub Actions' job scheduling).
  **Correction (post-review, via a second Codex review comment on PR #2904):
  the shared-state audit this paragraph called for already exists, for this
  exact file, a few paragraphs up (lines 1928-1942 above) — restating it as
  an open next step would have had a future pass redo completed work.**
  That audit found every sibling test in `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e.rs` that
  calls `job::start_runtime` holds `global_job_runtime_test_lock()` first,
  including this entry's own target test, which (per the source) holds that
  lock for its **entire** runtime — so under default parallelism, any other
  lock-holding sibling scheduled concurrently would simply block on the
  mutex until the target test releases it, never truly interleaving with
  it. That rules the process-global `GLOBAL_JOB_CLIENT` back *out* as the
  same-binary mechanism too, not just as the original cross-process one —
  the same conclusion, reached the same way, applies to both framings. If
  same-binary parallelism is still the right layer (unconfirmed, not ruled
  out — only this one specific shared resource is), the culprit would have
  to be a *different*, still-unidentified resource shared outside that
  lock's coverage — **not** a shared on-disk database path: **correction
  (post-review, via a fourth Codex review comment on PR #2904)**, each test
  builds its own `tempfile::TempDir` and `build_sqlite_pool` places
  `jobs_scheduler.db` under that unique directory
  (`autumn/tests/sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e.rs:78-80`), so sibling tests
  cannot collide on a shared database file even under default parallelism —
  that candidate is excluded by per-test isolation, not by the lock. What
  remains open is a different process-global the lock doesn't cover, or
  something not yet identified. Auditing for that
  specific gap — not re-auditing `GLOBAL_JOB_CLIENT` or a shared database
  file, both closed — plus a harness variant that runs the *whole*
  `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e` binary
  at default parallelism (not `--test-threads=1`, not filtered to one test)
  N times, is the concrete next step for a future pass.

- **2026-09-23 — reproduced (4/50), the trigger is pinned, and the mechanism
  is now confirmed by instrumentation.** The 2026-09-22 update above named its
  own next step: "a harness variant that runs the *whole*
  `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e` binary at default parallelism (not
  `--test-threads=1`, not filtered to one test) N times". That was run
  locally, on `trunk-dev`:

  ```
  cargo test -p autumn-web --features "sqlite,test-support,storage" \
    --test sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e -j1
  ```

  No test filter and no `--test-threads` flag — the shape `ci.yml`'s "Run the
  sqlite integration suite" step uses. Looped 50 times. **Result: `4/50
  failed`** (runs 7, 11, 12 and 49), each the byte-identical panic this entry
  opened on, each `test result: FAILED. 26 passed; 1 failed`, and in every
  case the failing test was `sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably`
  and only it.

  **Serialized control, same commit, same machine, same whole binary:
  `0/50`.** The identical loop with `-- --test-threads=1` added (still no test
  filter) passed every iteration. The pair discriminates the two candidate
  layers: **concurrency inside the one test binary is the trigger, not test
  order and not the host.**

  This also reads the earlier clean runs correctly. The local `0/50` and the
  CI-native `0/50` above both passed `--test-threads=1` **and** filtered to
  the single test — the one configuration that cannot reproduce this. Those
  100 reruns measured a lane the defect does not live in, so they are not
  evidence of a low true rate. Measured the way CI runs this binary, the rate
  is about 8%, which fits n=2 organic hits in a day of ambient traffic.
  `manual-sqlite-jobs-rerun-check.yml` cannot reproduce this flake by
  construction, and its loop needs to run the whole binary at default
  parallelism before it can give a baseline that means anything.

- **2026-09-23 — root cause: a pooled connection whose cached schema predates
  the queue index.** With a repro in hand, the enqueue error path in
  `autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs` was instrumented (temporary, not merged) to dump
  state at the moment of the failure. Five instrumented runs, each stopping at
  the first failure, give this chain:

  1. `sqlite_master` on the **failing connection**, read immediately after the
     error, holds `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_autumn_jobs_unique_inflight ON
     autumn_jobs (name, unique_key) WHERE unique_key IS NOT NULL AND status IN
     ('enqueued', 'running')` — the exact index the `ON CONFLICT` target names.
     The index is not missing and its shape is not wrong.
  2. `pragma_index_list('autumn_jobs')` on the same connection reports
     `idx_autumn_jobs_unique_inflight/unique=1/partial=1`, and
     `pragma_table_info` reports all 23 columns. `pragma_database_list` names
     the test's own `TempDir` file, and `sqlite_temp_master` is empty — so it
     is the right file and no temp table shadows the real one.
  3. A minimal `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (name, unique_key) WHERE ... DO NOTHING`
     re-run on that same connection **fails again**, identically. The failure
     is not transient on that connection.
  4. The same minimal statement on a **fresh connection from the same pool
     succeeds**. The defect is per-connection, not per-file.
  5. `ON CONFLICT (id)` — the primary key — **succeeds** on the failing
     connection. It resolves a conflict target on this table; it cannot
     resolve this partial one.
  6. Forcing that connection to re-parse the schema (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT
     EXISTS diag_touch (x)` then `DROP TABLE`) and re-running the identical
     statement **succeeds**.

  Step 6 is the decisive one: the statement, the file and the index are all
  unchanged, and only the connection's view of the schema changed. **The
  failing connection holds a cached schema that predates
  `ensure_schema`'s `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`, and SQLite does not reload it, so
  the upsert's partial-index target cannot be resolved at prepare time.**
  (`PRAGMA schema_version` reads the file, so it reports the same value on
  both connections and does not contradict this.)

  **Why this test and why under parallelism.** `enqueue_tracked`
  (`autumn/src/job_tracking.rs:1147`) calls `store.create(...)` **before**
  `client.enqueue_with_outcome(...)`. The tracking store takes a pooled
  connection and runs its own DDL on it first; the queue's `ensure_schema`
  then runs on whichever connection the pool hands **it**. When those are two
  different connections, the first one is left holding a schema from before
  the queue index existed, and the insert fails whenever the pool gives that
  connection back. Which connection the pool returns depends on timing, which
  is why load inside the test binary flips it and `--test-threads=1` hides it.

- **Test-vs-product verdict: product defect.** The race is in
  `SqliteJobQueue`'s schema readiness, not in the test. `ready()` marks the
  schema ready for the **queue**, while the DDL was applied to **one
  connection**. Any Autumn app on SQLite whose pool holds a connection older
  than the queue's first `ensure_schema` can fail its first enqueue the same
  way; the test only makes it likely by opening a connection for the tracking
  record first. A fix belongs in `autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs`, not in
  `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e.rs`. Not written in this pass — recorded here so
  the fix is a separate, reviewable change.

- **2026-09-23 — fixed and closed.** PR #2925 merged the fix in
  `autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs`: `ensure_schema` now drops every idle pooled
  connection once it has created the schema, so the pool serves only
  connections opened after `idx_autumn_jobs_unique_inflight` exists. It runs
  once per process, behind the schema cell.

  **Verified by the reproduction this entry established**, not by a clean rerun
  of a lane the defect never lived in: the loop that failed 4 of 50 before the
  change passed 100 of 100 after it, same machine, same command. A unit test in
  `autumn/src/job/sqlite.rs` asserts the pool holds no connection opened before
  `ensure_schema`, and fails with the change reverted.

  **Known residual, recorded rather than hidden**: a connection checked out by
  other code while the schema is being created is not idle, so it is not
  dropped, and it can come back stale. No framework path does that today.
  Closing it would mean retrying the upsert on a fresh connection, which is a
  larger change than this failure warranted.

  **Lesson for this ledger**: a rerun harness that does not reproduce a flake
  measures nothing about its rate. Both earlier 50-run baselines passed
  `--test-threads=1` and filtered to one test, and the defect needed neither.
  Match the harness to how CI actually runs the binary before reading a clean
  result as evidence.

- **2026-09-24 verification — fix holding, 0 new recurrences.** Sampled
  `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs across the ~14.2h following PR #2925's merge
  (2026-09-23T19:33:05Z through 2026-09-24T09:42:24Z — the tail end of the
  broader ~37.85h window described in the `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-24
  dated update below, most of which predates the merge). One hit of this
  test's own failure signature was found in that broader window (run
  35866381449, branch `claude/sleepy-brown-7ke3xk`, job completed
  2026-09-23T13:36:52Z), but that completion time is ~6 hours **before** the
  fix's merge, and outside the ~14.2h post-merge window this verification
  actually covers — it is the same pre-fix occurrence this entry's own
  reproduction campaign already accounts for, not a new recurrence. Zero
  hits among the `success`/`failure`-concluded runs in the ~14.2h sampled
  after the merge.
  **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2942): an
  earlier version of this note and the corresponding `live_upgrade` update
  below misstated the post-merge verification interval as "~38h," which was
  the full sampling window's span, not the portion after the merge.**
  **Second correction (post-review, via a further Codex review comment on PR
  #2942): the "zero hits" claim was not scoped to what was actually
  inspected.** `ci.yml`'s `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true` (lines 9-11)
  means a job inside a `cancelled`-overall run can still have completed with
  a failing test before the run itself was marked cancelled by a superseding
  push. The cancelled runs inside the post-merge window were not inspected
  at job level this pass, so this verification covers only the
  `success`/`failure`-concluded runs in that window, not an exhaustive sweep
  of every job that ran.
- **2026-09-25 verification — still holding, 0 new recurrences.** All 6
  `Test (Docker)`-family failures found in this pass's sampling (see the
  `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-25 dated update, and the new **Open
  entries** section above) are the newly-quarantined `quay.io/minio/minio`
  outage; none carry this test's own signature. Same cancelled-run and
  reliable-window caveats as every prior verification note apply.

## Under active investigation, not yet quarantined

These are tracked here because they are the subject of an open rerun
campaign, not because a skip has been applied — per Semaphore's own rule
that a raised timeout, added sleep, or added retry is not a valid response
to an unconfirmed flake. Do **not** add a `--skip`/`#[ignore]` for these
without also filling in the intake form above.

### `hot-upgrade::live_upgrade::upgrades_in_place_under_load_without_dropping_a_connection_or_the_state`

- **2026-09-10 update — a third Linux/coverage signature hit, then a
  same-day fix landed on `trunk-dev` naming three mechanisms.** Sampling
  the 24.5h since the 2026-09-09 follow-up (86 `pull_request`-triggered
  `ci.yml` runs, 55 cancelled/23 success/8 failure) turned up one more
  organic hit, on the same `Coverage (workspace)`/Linux job shape as the
  prior day's line-567 hit: run 34360601529 (branch
  `claude/friendly-ritchie-rex1a9`, job id 102530590317), 2026-09-09T13:59Z.
  Panic at `examples/hot-upgrade/tests/live_upgrade.rs:552:5`: `"every read
  must be served across the cutover, saw [Observation { status: 0, body:
  "", latency: 295.896µs }, Observation { status: 0, body: "", latency:
  406.843µs }]"`, with the connection-error counters printed immediately
  above it all reading zero: `"connection failures across cutover:
  refused=0 hard_failures_after_retry=0 mid_flight_resets_retried=0"`. A
  third distinct assertion/signature on the same test (not the macOS
  connect-error cluster, not the Linux line-567 "new build never served"
  hit) — fetched via the job's raw log blob URL after `get_job_logs` with
  `return_content=true` truncated the tail before reaching the panic line
  (the test's own per-request tracing spam is large enough that even an
  8000-line tail landed short; the untruncated blob URL was needed).
  Two Linux/`Coverage (workspace)` hits on this test inside roughly 24
  hours (2026-09-09 pre-09:47Z and 2026-09-09T13:59Z), both organic,
  reinforced that this was not a macOS-only mechanism.

  **Same day, `trunk-dev`'s tip (`8fae8af`, PR #2645, merged
  2026-09-10T04:56:32Z) landed a fix titled "Fix live_upgrade test: three
  real timing races, not flakes"**, authored independent of this ledger's
  own tracking. It names three mechanisms, all test-defect (not
  product-defect — the hot-upgrade handoff mechanism itself was not
  changed) and root-caused rather than tolerance-widened:
  1. The seed request could race v1's own startup barrier
     (`StartupBarrierLayer` in `router.rs` can still 503 ordinary traffic
     after `capture_bound_addr` sees the bind-log line but before
     `on_startup` hooks finish) — fixed with a `wait_until_ready` poll
     bounded to the codebase's existing 30s upgrade budget.
  2. The fixed 3.5s post-signal window assumed the cutover itself is fast,
     with no budget behind that number — this is the mechanism behind the
     2026-09-09 Linux line-567 "new build never served" hit. Replaced with
     an adaptive wait (same 30s bound) for `successor_pid`, keeping 3.5s as
     further sustained traffic after cutover rather than the sole signal.
  3. A read can land on the *successor's* own startup barrier (v2 can
     legitimately `accept()` and 503 before `mark_startup_complete`) —
     `with_startup_barrier_retry` now retries it, bounded, mirroring how
     `with_reset_retry` already treats a mid-flight reset as
     expected-but-bounded.

  **Correction (post-review): do not attribute the 2026-09-09T13:59Z hit to
  mechanism 3.** An earlier version of this entry read that hit's
  `Observation { status: 0, body: "" }` pair as "the client-side shape of
  the same successor-not-ready-yet race." Checked against the merged
  source (`examples/hot-upgrade/tests/live_upgrade.rs`) rather than
  asserted from the log alone: `is_startup_barrier_response` requires an
  *exact* match — `observation.status == 503 && observation.body ==
  "Service is still starting up"` — and `with_startup_barrier_retry` only
  retries when that predicate holds; any other outcome, `status: 0`
  included, is returned immediately, unretried (`live_upgrade.rs:394`).
  A `status: 0`/empty-body observation is not an HTTP 503 response either
  way, so it fails that predicate and mechanism 3's retry would not have
  touched it. **Correction (post-review): do not narrow this to
  "connection-level."** An earlier version of this paragraph read
  `status: 0` as meaning no HTTP response was received at all. Checked
  against `get()` itself (`live_upgrade.rs:93-125`): a connect/write/read
  syscall failure returns `Err` and feeds `refused_errors`/`hard_failures`
  directly — a genuinely distinct path from this observation. `status: 0`
  is instead assigned via `.unwrap_or(0)` on the `Ok` path, whenever the
  response text's second whitespace-separated token isn't there or doesn't
  parse as a status code — which an empty read after a bare `accept()`
  would produce, but so would a malformed or truncated *non-empty* reply;
  the raw bytes weren't logged, so which of those actually happened here is
  unknown. Classify this as an unparseable/unknown response, not a
  connection-level failure. Since
  the failing run's own counter line (`refused=0
  hard_failures_after_retry=0 mid_flight_resets_retried=0`, with no
  `startup_barrier_hits` figure — that counter didn't exist yet in the
  pre-fix test) shows none of the *named* failure modes fired either, this
  signature is **not yet explained by any of the three mechanisms above**
  and stays an open, unattributed data point. Whether PR #2645 happens to
  fix it anyway (as a side effect of mechanism 1 or 2, which do run earlier
  in the same request path) is untested — that is exactly the kind of claim
  the CI-native rerun campaign below exists to settle, not something to
  assert from a single log.

  The fix's own verification, per its commit message: `cargo llvm-cov
  --no-report -p hot-upgrade --test live_upgrade` (a targeted, instrumented
  local rerun — **correction (post-review): not the exact build CI's
  `Coverage` job uses**, see below) passed 9+ consecutive runs across two
  local contention levels (4-8 and 16 busy loops on 4 cores), including runs
  that hit the barrier and still passed. That is real evidence and a named
  mechanism per test, satisfying the hard gate's diagnosis requirement — but
  it is a local, self-reported rerun count on a narrower build than CI's,
  not the CI-native same-commit campaign this role's own evidentiary bar
  calls for before treating an entry as closed.

  **Correction (post-review): the local command above is not CI's build.**
  `ci.yml`'s actual "Generate coverage (workspace catch-all)" step runs
  `cargo llvm-cov clean --workspace` followed by `cargo llvm-cov --workspace
  --exclude autumn-web --exclude autumn-cli --all-features --no-report` —
  a full-workspace, all-features build carrying every other crate's
  instrumentation and compile/link load in the same process, not a
  single-package `-p hot-upgrade --test live_upgrade` run with the default
  feature set. The two plausibly differ in exactly the dimension this
  investigation cares about (contention/timing), so record the fix's own
  9+ runs as targeted instrumented reruns that support the diagnosis, not
  as a rerun of the CI build itself.

  **Correction (post-review): closing this entry needs two separate,
  distinct pieces of evidence, not one dispatch — and the macOS half's
  required sample count was also stated wrong.** An earlier version of this
  paragraph said running `manual-macos-contention-check.yml` once (option
  (a)) would close the entry, and separately claimed the macOS cluster's
  historical rate is sub-10% (requiring ≥50 samples). Both need fixing:

  1. **The rate is not sub-10%, so ≥20 is the applicable bar, not ≥50.**
     The macOS cluster's own measured rate, from this entry's "Observed"
     line below, is 3/17 (≈17.6%); folding in the 13/13 clean organic
     samples #2548 banked since #2510 merged gives 3/30 (exactly 10%, not
     *below* 10%). This role's own operating standard escalates to ≥50 only
     for genuinely low-rate (sub-10%) flakes — a rate at or above 10% stays
     on the standard ≥20 bar. A single 20-sample dispatch of
     `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`, at its `samples` input's maximum
     (a `type: choice` capped at `["5", "10", "20"]`), can therefore reach
     the applicable bar for the macOS half in one run, not three.
  2. **That one dispatch still cannot close the whole entry**, because this
     harness is macOS-only and cannot touch either Linux/`Coverage
     (workspace)` signature at all — those need a still-unbuilt second
     harness with its own rerun count, run against CI's actual
     coverage-lane command, before *that* half can close.

  **Not closing this entry yet, on either half.** Zero organic hits in the
  small post-merge window sampled here (one push-triggered run on
  `trunk-dev` at the fix commit itself, success) — reassuring, but n=1, not
  evidence.

- **Observed**: 3/17 eligible `macos-latest` CI executions (14 confirmed, 3
  unresolved — see the 2026-09-04 census for the derivation), 0/16-17 on
  `ubuntu-latest`, organic PR-traffic sample, 2026-09-03/04.
- **New organic hit, 2026-09-09, on a Linux runner at a different assertion
  — tracked as a separate signature, not yet unified with the macOS
  cluster**: run 34317587464 (PR #2645, branch `claude/wizardly-wright-i1jsql`),
  job `Coverage (workspace)`, a plain hosted `ubuntu-latest` runner
  (confirmed via the job's own `labels`). This run got a plain hosted
  runner not because `coverage` is exempt from `heavy_runs_on` — it isn't;
  `coverage`, like `test-docker`, `trybuild`, and `loom`, uses
  `runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(needs.meta.outputs.heavy_runs_on) }}` directly and
  unconditionally (only the `test` job's matrix wraps it in a
  `matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest' && ... || matrix.os` ternary) — but because
  `runner-routing.yml` hard-codes `heavy_runs_on` to `["ubuntu-latest"]` for
  every `pull_request` event, by construction (self-hosted routing is
  structurally restricted to base-repo-controlled events — push,
  workflow_dispatch, schedule — since a PR's workflow file comes from a
  fork-controlled head). So this run drew a standard runner, not a
  contended self-hosted one, but "standard GitHub-hosted" is not itself a
  measured contention level — the actual load on either this runner or any
  of the 3 macOS runners in the earlier hits is unmeasured in both
  directions. Step "Generate coverage (workspace catch-all)" runs `cargo
  llvm-cov`, which instruments every test binary it wraps; this job's own
  inline comment notes that roughly doubles `target/`'s on-disk *size* —
  no wall-clock runtime measurement was taken here, so treat any execution
  overhead as unquantified, not a confirmed slowdown. Failure is at
  `tests/live_upgrade.rs:567`: `"the new build should have served part of
  the load"` — the v2 binary never appeared in the observed read set —
  which is a **different assertion** than `assert_eq!(connect_errors, 0)`
  at the file's then-`line 268`, the connection-error check the 3 macOS
  hits above were classified against per the 2026-09-04 census. That
  single counter has since been split by the #2510 fix into `refused == 0`
  / `hard == 0` around today's lines 520-528 — cited by name rather than a
  guessed current line number, since the file has been refactored since
  the census ran. Full run: 5 passed, 1 failed in the `hot-upgrade`
  package.
  - **Why this is logged here but not folded into the macOS cluster's
    diagnosis**: same test file, but a different assertion can mean a
    different bug entirely — "the new build never took over" and "requests
    saw connection errors during cutover" are not obviously the same
    failure mode just because they share a test. Do not treat this as
    disproving, or as evidence against, the macOS-specific framing of the
    *existing* 3-hit cluster; treat it as a fourth, separate data point
    that argues the still-undispatched rerun campaign (below) should not
    stay macOS-only, since a hot-upgrade timing sensitivity may exist on
    more than one platform — without yet claiming those sensitivities
    share a mechanism. Only a rerun campaign that reproduces the *same*
    signature on both platforms would justify unifying them.
- **Verdict not yet rendered** *(superseded — see the 2026-09-10 update at
  the top of this entry)*: whether the line-567 signature is a
  runner-class/contention timing dependence in the test's load-window
  design, a genuine narrow race in the hot-upgrade handoff
  (`autumn/src/upgrade.rs`) that slow execution merely exposes more
  reliably, or an unrelated failure mode from the 3 macOS connection-error
  hits entirely. All three remain open. **Superseded 2026-09-10**: PR
  #2645's mechanism 2 names this exact signature in its own commit message
  ("no read observed a v2 response inside the fixed window") and fixes it
  as a runner-class/contention timing dependence in the test's own
  load-window design — the first of these three options, confirmed
  test-defect rather than a product handoff race, not merely "slow
  execution exposing" one. Diagnosed-and-fixed still isn't the same as
  closed-per-this-role's-bar (see the 2026-09-10 update's own closure
  paragraph) — this note marks the verdict as rendered, not the entry as
  closed.
- **2026-09-11 update — harness still undispatched (4th consecutive daily
  pass); zero new organic hits inside the sampled window, but one landed
  live afterward on this ledger's own tracking PR.** **Correction
  (post-review, via a thirteenth Codex review comment on PR #2711): the
  original headline here said "zero new organic hits" unscoped, which
  went stale the moment the live hit below was logged in this same
  entry.** Scoped now: zero hits in the sampled 109-run window; one hit
  (run 34591670807, a `status: 0` repeat) outside it — see below.
  Sampled the ~23.3h since the 2026-09-10 follow-up's actual recorded
  cutoff (`2026-09-10T09:48:19Z`–`2026-09-11T09:09:24Z`; **correction,
  post-review, via a sixth Codex review comment on PR #2711**: an earlier
  version of this line understated the window as starting at
  `10:30:30Z`, silently skipping the 42-minute gap between the two
  reports — that gap was separately queried and holds 9 more
  `pull_request`-triggered `ci.yml` runs, all cancelled, no failures, so
  the combined population is 109 runs: 70 cancelled/25 success/14
  failure, not 100/61/25/14). **Second correction (post-review, via an
  eleventh Codex review comment on PR #2711): the 100-run figure itself
  was only ever a page-1 result at the `perPage=100` ceiling, not verified
  complete.** This repo's `total_count` for the underlying query grew
  visibly during the pass (~7369 → ~8191), evidence of continuous
  concurrent writes that can shift page boundaries between fetches.
  Checked page 2 of the identical query: it overlaps this window's near
  edge (`2026-09-09T10:07:59Z`–`2026-09-10T10:46:39Z`, i.e. past the
  page-1 minimum), and every run in the overlap back to the actual cutoff
  is accounted for — 16 runs, all cancelled/success except one failure
  (34467823999) already identified above. No additional failures surfaced
  there, but the window's far edge (near `2026-09-11T09:09:24Z`) was never
  independently re-checked against a later page, and sampling by
  wall-clock time plus a fixed page count is not reproducible against a
  table this actively written to. Full reasoning and the reproduce
  command are in the 2026-09-11 report; a future pass sampling this repo
  should anchor to a stable run ID or commit rather than wall-clock time.
  **Live organic hit during this same PR's own CI, 2026-09-11T11:51:57Z —
  a second occurrence of the previously-unattributed `status: 0`
  signature, now also on a plain `Test (ubuntu-latest)` job with no
  coverage instrumentation.** PR #2711 (this ledger's own PR) is a
  docs-only change with no code diff, so this is pure organic CI noise
  from `trunk-dev`'s current `live_upgrade.rs`, not anything this PR
  touched. Run 34591670807, job `Test (ubuntu-latest)`
  (`check_run_id` 103245977784), branch `claude/sleepy-brown-uykw44`
  at the same base commit as `trunk-dev`'s tip (which already carries the
  #2645 fix — confirmed `8fae8af` is an ancestor). Panic at
  `examples/hot-upgrade/tests/live_upgrade.rs:686:5`: `"every read must be
  served across the cutover, saw [Observation { status: 0, body: "",
  latency: 554.629µs }]"` — a single `status: 0`/empty-body observation,
  same shape as the 2026-09-09T13:59Z hit this ledger already logged as
  not matching any of PR #2645's three named predicates. `refused`/`hard`/
  retry-bound assertions above this line did not panic, so those counters
  were clean, consistent with the earlier hit. This is now two occurrences
  of this exact signature, and — significantly — this one is on the plain
  `Test (ubuntu-latest)` job, **not** `Coverage (workspace)`, which weakens
  the working assumption (never more than a hypothesis) that this
  signature needs `cargo llvm-cov` instrumentation to manifest: it doesn't.
  Still undiagnosed and still not campaigned (n=2, not a formal rerun
  protocol), but this raises its priority for the still-unbuilt
  Linux-shaped rerun harness the 2026-09-09/10 reports already flagged as
  needed — it is not coverage-specific after all, so a plain `cargo test`
  rerun harness (Linux, no `llvm-cov`) could reproduce it, which is a
  cheaper harness to build than previously assumed. (This hit is outside
  the sampled 109-run window above — it landed live, after the window
  closed — so it is not one of the 14 counted failures there.)

  Of the 14 failures counted in the sampled window itself, none match
  `live_upgrade`, `cache_stampede`, or `sim_fault_plan` —
  see the new `job_tracking_stores_integration` entry below for the one
  finding this pass did turn up, on a different test entirely.
  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-11T~09:5xZ — unchanged for a
  4th straight day since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z.
  Zero organic hits this pass is reassuring but a ~23h window is not a
  substitute for the rerun campaign below; the recommendation to dispatch
  it (macOS half only, `samples: "20"`) stands unchanged from the
  2026-09-10 pass.
- **2026-09-13 update — 5th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new organic hits on any of the four tracked tests (`live_upgrade`'s
  three signatures included, six signatures total) in the sampled
  window.** Sampled `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs from roughly
  2026-09-12T13:58Z to 2026-09-13T09:02Z (~19 hours, ~130+ runs spanning
  both pages of the query) — **best-effort, not proven-exhaustive**: the
  two pages were fetched separately against a table under continuous
  concurrent writes with no anchor to a stable run ID between them, the
  same pagination risk this ledger already flagged in the 2026-09-11
  entry above. Every failure this sample surfaced was attributed to
  one of: the pre-existing MinIO/Docker-Hub outage (pre-#2740, before
  17:03:52Z), the four-diagnosis MinIO-fix escape documented above (two
  corrected intervals, 17:46:17Z-23:19:07Z and 23:22:06Z-02:09:18Z), or a
  WIP branch's own in-progress bug (a
  `dependabot` toolchain bump breaking `semver_script_checks_...`, a
  `capture_min_length` feature branch, repeated `Clippy` churn on single
  branches iterating on lint fixes). None matched `live_upgrade`,
  `cache_stampede`, `sim_fault_plan`, or (see below)
  `job_tracking_stores_integration`. `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`:
  still `total_count: 0` against `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked
  2026-09-13T~09:1xZ — unchanged for a 5th straight day since it became
  dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now ~114 hours idle).
- **2026-09-14 update — 6th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new organic hits on any of the four tracked tests (`live_upgrade`'s
  three signatures included, six signatures total) across everything
  checked this pass.** Sampled `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs from the
  2026-09-13 report's own cutoff (2026-09-13T09:02Z) to 2026-09-14T08:00:19Z
  (~23 hours, one `perPage=100` page whose own span fully covers the window
  with margin on both ends, so a second page was not needed this pass — 71
  runs: 45 cancelled/24 success/2 failure). Both run-level failures triaged
  by job/log inspection and attributed to their own branch's in-progress
  work, neither a CI health issue: a `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0`
  bump broke its own `fuzz/Cargo.lock` (`--locked` refused the implicit
  update) and, separately, `PostForm`'s `Validate` trait bound (`E0599` on
  `into_changeset`) — both direct, deterministic consequences of that PR's
  own dependency bump; and `claude/happy-edison-fstb1z` (previously flagged
  for its own `Clippy` churn) failed a `Test (windows-latest)` repo-hygiene
  self-check (`edge_conformance_ci_coverage`) because that branch's own
  in-progress `ci.yml` edit hadn't finished restoring the
  `edge-conformance:` job block.
  **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2786): the
  original version of this pass called the whole window "zero hits" from
  only the two run-level failures, but 45 of the 71 runs were `cancelled`
  overall — and `ci.yml`'s `cancel-in-progress` means a job can fail before
  its run gets superseded and marked `cancelled`, so those were not
  established zero-hit observations.** Checked job-level conclusions for the
  28 most-recently-created of the 45 cancelled runs (62%, best-effort
  sample — a contiguous prefix by `created_at` descending, from 34773833346
  through 34819892079; the remaining 17, from 34748838991 through
  34771611140, weren't checked — full ID list in the matching report's
  correction note). **Second correction (post-review, caught while
  reproducing this claim for the "fixed" correction below, not a Codex
  finding): the sample was originally miscounted as 26/45; it is 28/45.**
  Found one hidden job-level failure: run 34774043482
  (branch `claude/epic-meitner-vkej1i`, created 2026-09-13T18:15:04Z,
  overall `cancelled` when superseded by that branch's next push 13 minutes
  later) had `Test (ubuntu-latest)` and `Test (windows-latest)` both
  complete with conclusion `failure` first, on the identical test on both
  platforms: `starters::tests::embedded_cms_matches_example_cms`
  (`autumn-cli/src/starters/mod.rs:664:13`), `` assertion `left == right`
  failed: drift between embedded cms starter and examples/cms at
  src/routes/front.rs `` — a repo-hygiene drift-check between the embedded
  CMS starter template and `examples/cms`'s actual source, firing
  identically on both OS runners because it's a pure file-diff assertion.
  Branch-owned. **Third correction (post-review, via a further Codex review
  comment on PR #2786): the same run had two other jobs — `Test (Docker)`
  and `Test (macos-latest)` — that ran ~38 and ~40 minutes respectively
  before being cancelled, long enough to have hidden a tracked-signature
  panic from a conclusion-only check.** Fetched and grepped both full logs
  for the four tracked signature names and any panic/`FAILED` marker: the
  Docker job actually ran and passed
  `job_tracking_stores_integration::postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it`
  (`... ok`) before being cancelled — positive evidence, not absence — with
  nothing matching any tracked signature anywhere in the log; the macOS job
  was killed mid-`cargo build` (`Terminate orphan process: pid (37808)
  (rustc)`) and never reached the test phase. Separately, for every one of
  the other 27 sampled cancelled runs, every `Test`-shaped job shows the
  *unexpanded* matrix template name with conclusion `cancelled` and
  near-simultaneous created/started/completed timestamps — direct evidence
  those jobs never started, so they carry no risk of hiding a signature
  either.
  **Fourth correction (post-review, via a further Codex review comment on
  PR #2786, written chronologically before the third correction above):
  whether the branch's next push fixed it is unverified, not
  established.** An earlier version of this entry claimed the branch's very
  next push (run 34777703864, ~13 minutes later) "evidently fixed it"
  because the signature didn't recur in the other 25 sampled cancelled
  runs — but that run's own `Test`/`Trybuild`/`Windows Tier 1 journey` jobs
  all show the *unexpanded* matrix template name with conclusion
  `cancelled` and near-simultaneous created/started/completed timestamps,
  consistent with being cancelled before the matrix job even started, not
  after running the test — so there is no completed test-job conclusion
  from that run either way. Absence of a repeat signature in a sample of
  cancelled runs whose own Test jobs were themselves cancelled before
  completing is not evidence anything passed; it's absence of observation.
  Corrected: not observed again in the runs sampled this pass, full stop —
  whether or how it was fixed is unverified. Not a CI health issue, and no
  match to any tracked signature, regardless — but a real correction to the
  earlier "zero hits" framing (and then to the unverified "fixed" framing)
  nonetheless.
  Nothing found this pass — the two run-level failures plus the one
  job-level failure inside a cancelled run — matched `live_upgrade`,
  `cache_stampede`, `sim_fault_plan`, or `job_tracking_stores_integration`.
  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-14T~08:0xZ — unchanged for a
  6th straight pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now
  ~137 hours idle).
- **2026-09-15 update — 7th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new organic hits on any of `live_upgrade`'s three signatures across
  the ~25.6h window sampled this pass (2026-09-14T08:00:19Z, exclusive, to
  2026-09-15T09:39:00Z — exclusive so as not to double-count run 34820504735,
  already in the 2026-09-14 report's own success list at that exact boundary
  timestamp — 67 runs: 50 cancelled/10 success/7 failure).** All 7 run-level failures
  triaged (see `docs/reports/2026-09-15-semaphore-ci-health-followup.md`):
  5 were the new RUSTSEC-2026-0285 `Supply chain (cargo-deny)` escape (its
  own new closed entry above), 1 was a pre-existing, unrelated
  `fuzz/Cargo.lock` staleness on the `validator-0.21.0` dependabot PR, and 1
  was a second organic hit on `job_tracking_stores_integration` (its own
  entry below) — none matched `live_upgrade`. This pass did **not** repeat
  the 2026-09-14 pass's cancelled-run job-level sampling (checking whether a
  `cancelled`-overall run hid a job-level `failure`), so — per that same
  caveat — this is not a proven-exhaustive zero-hit finding across the full
  67-run window, only across the 17 runs that resolved to `success`/`failure`
  and were actually inspected. `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still
  `total_count: 0` against `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked
  2026-09-15T~09:5xZ — unchanged for a 7th straight pass since it became
  dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now ~162.5 hours idle, a full week).
- **2026-09-16 update — 8th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  TWO organic hits in a single ~24h window, breaking a three-pass zero-hit
  streak, one of them a brand-new signature.** Sampled `ci.yml`
  `pull_request` runs from the 2026-09-15 report's own cutoff
  (2026-09-15T09:39:00Z, exclusive) to 2026-09-16T09:40:05Z (~24h, two
  `perPage=100` pages: page 1 covered 2026-09-15T16:38:14Z–09:40:05Z, page 2
  covered back to 2026-09-14T07:25:10Z with margin past the window's near
  edge) — 119 runs: 88 cancelled/18 success/13 failure. All 13 run-level
  failures triaged by job/log inspection: **correction (post-review, via a
  Codex review comment on PR #2823): the original pass of this ledger entry
  said 11 `Clippy`/`Lint` failures, which double-counted one run and made
  the categories sum to 15 against a 13-run total — it is 9.** 9 were a WIP
  branch's own `Clippy`/`Lint` failure (`claude/determined-bardeen-unefhv`
  alone accounts for 4 of these, iterating on the same fix across pushes;
  `claude/eager-turing-gqo7ng` 2; `claude/inspiring-ramanujan-95ccd6`,
  `vesper/bugbash-2801-pdf-depth-warn`, and
  `vesper/bugbash-2370-dump-cache-coherence-env` 1 each), 1 was
  `vesper/macro-crate-split`'s own multi-job break (Lint, MSRV,
  Plugin API contract, SQLite runtime, Edge capsule conformance, Sim sweep,
  Supply chain, and a `Markdown link gate` failure all on the same run,
  consistent with an in-progress crate-split refactor rather than a CI
  health issue), and 1 was `claude/inspiring-ramanujan-95ccd6`'s own
  `pg_relative_delay_ci_coverage::pg_relative_delay_tests_are_named_in_ci`
  repo-hygiene self-check failing on `Test (windows-latest)`
  (`"job.rs no longer has a \`mod pg\` block inside \`mod tests\`"` —
  the same shape as this ledger's own repo-hygiene self-checks
  elsewhere, and clearly this branch's own in-progress `job.rs` edit, not
  a CI infra issue).

  **The remaining 2 are both `live_upgrade`, both on `Coverage (workspace)`,
  both organic (neither triggering branch touches hot-upgrade code):**
  1. Run 35044877808 (branch `claude/charming-planck-ag3glz`, completed
     2026-09-16T03:36:41Z): panic at
     `examples/hot-upgrade/tests/live_upgrade.rs:714:5`: `"the new build
     must accept writes after the cutover"` — **a signature not previously
     recorded in this entry.** The counter line printed immediately above
     it reads `"connection failures across cutover: refused=0
     hard_failures_after_retry=0 mid_flight_resets_retried=0
     startup_barrier_hits_retried=0"`. **Correction (post-review, via a
     Codex review comment on PR #2823): these four counters do not clear
     all three of PR #2645's named mechanisms.** `refused` and
     `hard_failures_after_retry` are connection-outcome counters this
     ledger already attributes to PR #2510, not #2645 (see that entry's
     "refused == 0 / hard == 0 split" note above); `mid_flight_resets_retried`
     predates #2645 too, via the pre-existing `with_reset_retry` path. Of
     #2645's own three mechanisms, only the third (the startup-barrier
     retry) has a dedicated counter — `startup_barrier_hits_retried`,
     clean here, ruling that one out for this occurrence. The other two
     (the `wait_until_ready` startup-barrier poll, and the adaptive
     post-cutover wait that replaced the old fixed 3.5s window) have no
     counter at all, so whether either was active is unknown from this log
     alone. **Second correction (post-review, via a further Codex review
     comment on PR #2823): "the write was rejected" overstates what the
     assertion actually checks.** Read against the test source
     (`examples/hot-upgrade/tests/live_upgrade.rs:706-718`): the panic
     fires when no element of `writes` has `status == 200 &&
     parse_line(&w.body).is_some_and(|r| r.version == "v2")` — i.e. no
     recorded post-cutover write observation was a parseable, v2-tagged
     200. The preceding loop in the same test already permits `status ==
     503` as an explicitly-allowed "refused as retryable" outcome, so this
     failure is equally consistent with every post-cutover write getting a
     503, a `v1`-tagged 200 (stale, not literally rejected), or a 200 with
     an unparseable body — not only an outright rejection. Recorded as "no
     post-cutover write observation matched 200+parseable+v2," not as a
     confirmed write rejection.
     `test result: FAILED. 5 passed; 1 failed`, same as every other hit
     on this test. Undiagnosed — a fourth distinct assertion on this test
     (after the macOS connection-error cluster, the Linux line-567
     "new build never served," and the line-686 `status: 0`/empty-body
     signature below), not yet folded into any existing hypothesis.
  2. Run 35069353632 (branch `claude/friendly-ritchie-wol314`, completed
     2026-09-16T09:15:56Z): panic at `./tests/live_upgrade.rs:686:5`,
     `test result: FAILED. 5 passed; 1 failed` — same line number and same
     pass/fail shape as the 2026-09-11 `status: 0` hit (run 34591670807)
     already logged above. The tail fetched for this run's log (220 lines)
     captured the backtrace and the preceding request-log spam but not the
     `thread '...' panicked at ...:686:5: <message>` banner line itself —
     it fell outside even that window, so the exact assertion text is
     **not independently re-confirmed this pass**; recorded as "consistent
     with, not confirmed as" the same `status: 0` signature, on line number
     and result shape alone. A wider tail or the raw log blob URL would be
     needed to confirm the message text exactly, per the same truncation
     caveat the 2026-09-11 entry already flagged for this job type.

  **Correction (post-review, via a further Codex review comment on PR
  #2823): "six straight passes (2026-09-09 through 2026-09-15)" of zero
  organic hits is wrong — this entry's own 2026-09-10 and 2026-09-11 dated
  updates above record organic hits (2026-09-09T13:59Z and
  2026-09-11T11:51:57Z respectively), so that range was not hit-free.**
  Only three consecutive passes are explicitly documented as zero-hit
  immediately before today: 2026-09-13, 2026-09-14, and 2026-09-15. Two
  hits in one day, breaking that three-pass zero-hit streak, is itself
  worth noting even though neither hit alone clears this role's own
  rerun-rate bar. **Second correction (post-review, via a further Codex
  review comment on PR #2823): line-552 and line-686 are the same `status: 0`
  signature at two different line numbers (the file was refactored between
  2026-09-09 and 2026-09-11), not two separate n=1 signatures — the
  2026-09-11 update above already states this explicitly ("now two
  occurrences of this exact signature").** Still not campaigned — n counts
  per signature now stand at: `status: 0` (line-552 2026-09-09 + line-686
  2026-09-11 = 2 confirmed occurrences before this pass; today's line-686
  hit would make 3 if its unconfirmed message text is later verified to
  match), line-567 (n=1, fixed by #2645's mechanism 2), and line-714 (n=1,
  new). `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-16T~09:5xZ — unchanged for an
  8th straight pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now
  ~186.5 hours idle, well over a week). The recommendation to dispatch it
  is now materially more urgent than a restatement: this pass found a
  brand-new failure signature (no post-cutover write observed as a
  parseable, v2-tagged 200 — not merely a read/connection issue) on a test
  covering exactly the hot-upgrade handoff path, and the harness that could
  start separating "timing-sensitive test" from "product race" has sat
  unexercised for over a week while the signature count on this one test
  keeps growing.
- **2026-09-17 update — 9th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched; a
  fourth observed occurrence of the line-686 signature.** Sampled `ci.yml`
  `pull_request` runs from the 2026-09-16 report's own cutoff
  (2026-09-16T09:40:05Z, exclusive) to 2026-09-17T09:59:29Z (~24.3h; the
  `status=completed` filter combined with `page=1` returned a stale,
  weeks-old slice on this pass — a new instance of the pagination
  instability this ledger has already flagged — worked around by combining
  a `status=completed`/`page=2` query for the window's near edge with an
  unfiltered `page=1` query for its far edge) — 120 runs: 81 cancelled/31
  success/7 failure/1 in-progress. Run 35089021085 (branch
  `claude/determined-bardeen-unefhv`, job `Test (ubuntu-latest)`, completed
  2026-09-16T12:14:00Z): `test result: FAILED. 5 passed; 1 failed`, failing
  test `upgrades_in_place_under_load_without_dropping_a_connection_or_the_state`.
  The available tail (400 lines) did not reach the panic banner text itself
  (the same per-request-tracing truncation this ledger has hit before on
  this test), but the backtrace frame for the test body resolves to
  `./tests/live_upgrade.rs:686:5` — the exact line already tracked as the
  `status: 0`/unparseable-response signature. **Correction (post-review, via
  a Codex review comment on PR #2833): this is not "a third occurrence,"
  and not "the first occurrence on a plain Test job."** Against this
  ledger's own prior entries: 2026-09-09 and 2026-09-11 are each confirmed
  by exact panic message text (2 confirmed occurrences); the 2026-09-16
  report's run 35069353632 matched only on line/shape, with message text
  explicitly not confirmed (a 3rd *observed*, not confirmed, hit — the
  2026-09-16 entry above says so itself: "consistent with, not confirmed
  as"). Today's run is therefore a 4th observed occurrence, with the line
  independently confirmed via the backtrace frame rather than inferred from
  result shape alone — a different evidentiary path than the 2026-09-16 hit,
  but not a step up to full text-confirmation the way 2026-09-09/11 were.
  Separately, the 2026-09-11 hit was already on a plain `Test (ubuntu-latest)`
  job per that entry's own text ("now also on a plain Test (ubuntu-latest)
  job with no coverage instrumentation") — so today's is a *second*
  occurrence on a plain `Test` job, not the first, though it does still
  reinforce (not newly establish) that this signature isn't
  coverage-instrumentation-specific. Verdict still not rendered; still short
  of a rerun-rate baseline.
  Of the other 6 failures this pass found, 5 were ordinary branch-owned
  WIP (`codex/locate-density-test-and-separate-metrics`'s own Clippy
  failure; `vesper/bugbash-2321-alpn`'s own stale-lockfile/formatting
  failure followed 34 minutes later by its own new ALPN test,
  `tls::tests::server_config_with_resolver_and_client_auth_advertise_the_same_alpn`,
  failing identically across all four `Test` platform jobs — confirmed by
  reading the `Test tls` job's log directly, not assumed from the branch
  name; `vesper/macro-crate-split`'s own recurring multi-job break, this
  time via a stale `fuzz/Cargo.lock`; `vesper/bugbash-2405-prelayer-content-type`'s
  own Clippy failure), and 1 is a `test-docker` build failure recorded and
  **fixed** in its own entry above, under "Closed entries"
  (`postgresql_embedded`'s GitHub API rate limit). None of the 6 matched
  `cache_stampede`, `sim_fault_plan`, or
  `job_tracking_stores_integration` — **caveat (post-review, via a further
  Codex review comment on PR #2833)**: only these 7 failure/1 in-progress
  runs were inspected at job level; the 81 `cancelled`-overall runs were
  not, and per this ledger's own 2026-09-14 correction (`cancel-in-progress:
  true` can let a job fail before its run is superseded and marked
  `cancelled`), this "no repeat" finding is scoped to the 8 runs actually
  inspected, not proven-exhaustive across the full 120-run window.
  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-17T~09:59Z — unchanged for a 9th
  straight pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now
  ~210.9 hours idle, close to 9 days). The recommendation to dispatch it
  stands, more overdue with each pass this signature keeps recurring
  uncampaigned.
- **2026-09-18 update — 10th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new hits on any of the three `live_upgrade` signatures.** Sampled
  `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs from the 2026-09-17 report's own cutoff
  (2026-09-17T09:59:29Z, exclusive) to 2026-09-18T07:33:38Z (~21.6h, a single
  `perPage=100`/`page=1` query whose own span, 2026-09-17T09:28:44Z–
  2026-09-18T07:33:38Z, fully covers the window with margin on both ends, so
  no second page was needed this pass) — 96 runs in-window: 80 cancelled, 14
  success, 2 failure. Both failures triaged by job/log inspection, neither
  matching any tracked signature: `claude/elegant-ptolemy-scqmqh` (run
  35254153432) failed its own `Determinism seam gate` repo-hygiene self-check
  inside the `Lint` job — a branch-owned WIP failure, not a CI health issue;
  `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0` (run 35232563734) failed both `Supply
  chain (cargo-deny)` (the same pre-existing `fuzz/Cargo.lock --locked`
  staleness this ledger has already attributed to this branch on prior
  passes) and `Test (Docker)` — the latter is a **new** failure shape on this
  branch, not previously logged: the validator 0.21.0 bump itself breaks
  `examples/ledger-admin-bulk-app`'s own `PostForm`/`update` handler
  (`E0277`/`E0599` on `Validate`/`IntoChangeset` trait bounds), i.e. the
  dependency bump this PR exists to land is what's actually broken — squarely
  this PR's own subject matter, not a CI health issue. Same caveat as prior
  passes: only the 2 run-level failures were inspected at job level; the 80
  `cancelled`-overall runs were not, so this "no repeat" finding is scoped to
  the runs actually inspected, not proven-exhaustive across the full 96-run
  window. `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-18T~10:1xZ — unchanged for a
  **10th** straight pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z
  (now ~235 hours idle, closing in on 10 days).

  **This pass also builds (but cannot yet dispatch) a second rerun harness**,
  `.github/workflows/manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml` — see the dated
  update on the `job_tracking_stores_integration` entry below for why now,
  what it does, and why it isn't dispatchable yet.
- **2026-09-21 update — 13th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new hits on any of the three `live_upgrade` signatures.** Sampled
  `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs from the 2026-09-20 report's own cutoff
  (2026-09-20T07:33:19Z, exclusive) to 2026-09-21T09:55:07Z (~26.4h, one
  `perPage=100`/`page=1` query whose own span, 2026-09-19T01:29:40Z–
  2026-09-21T09:55:07Z, fully covers the window with margin on both ends, so
  no second page was needed) — 75 runs in-window: 55 cancelled, 15 success,
  5 failure. All 5 failures triaged at job level:
  - Run 35540844428 (`claude/friendly-ritchie-d36hku`, PR #2842, a docs-only
    change touching only `ci.yml`, `README.md`, `changelog.d/`, `docs/guide/`,
    `scripts/check-docs-retrieval.sh`, and `skills/autumn-web/SKILL.md` — no
    Rust source, confirmed by reading the PR's own file list) failed both
    `Test (macos-latest)` and `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)`.
    **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2883): the
    `Test (macos-latest)` failure was originally dismissed here as
    "unrelated ... branch-owned," which is wrong — the PR's diff cannot own
    a failure in code it never touches.** The failing test,
    `autumn-macros-support`'s own unit test
    `crate_path::tests::resolve_autumn_web_name_dashed_rename_is_sanitized`
    (`left: "autumn_web", right: "autumn_web_05"`), is therefore an organic,
    not-yet-diagnosed hit — logged below as its own new entry, same as the
    SQLite finding. `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)` is the other new
    signature logged below.
  - Run 35523247491 (`claude/macro-split-decomposition-jalk90`, head
    `30729276b2f8a50b76b70110c0aeb4ca9596c59a`, "Move the repository macro's
    HTTP and retention slabs into their own modules," no open PR — the
    branch ref no longer exists on origin) failed the same two jobs:
    `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)` with the identical new signature, and
    `Test (Docker)` with a repeat of the already-**closed**
    `job_tracking_stores_integration::postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it`
    panic (`"record should be past its configured TTL"` at
    `job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:264:5` — the pre-fix line number, not
    the post-fix poll-based version). **Not a reopening.**
    **Correction (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR #2883): the
    original version of this entry claimed this branch's pre-fix status was
    "verified by git ancestry," but the `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
    command actually run only checked PR #2870's (`claude/epic-meitner-eh6w1m`)
    base commit, not this branch's — the two were conflated in prose.** This
    branch's actual head commit, fetched via the GitHub API (the branch ref
    itself is gone from origin, so a local `git merge-base` isn't possible
    against it anymore), has `committer.date: 2026-09-20T16:34:05Z`, and the
    CI run itself started `2026-09-20T16:36:30Z` — both well before the fix's
    merge at `2026-09-20T19:35:35Z` UTC. Combined with the panic's exact
    pre-fix line number and message text (which the post-fix version of the
    test no longer contains at all, having been rewritten to a polling loop),
    this is strong evidence of a pre-fix run, but by commit timestamp and
    source-text matching, not literal ancestry — corrected to say so.
  - Run 35530941996 (`claude/epic-meitner-eh6w1m`, PR #2870) failed
    `Test (Docker)` with the **same** pre-fix `job_tracking_stores_integration`
    signature (completed 2026-09-20T20:15:19Z, also before the 22:09:37Z UTC
    fix/close) — same explanation, same non-reopening. **This is the one
    branch actually checked by `git merge-base --is-ancestor`**: PR #2870's
    base sha `9800221460975e7b3ee75a8490e392cb4b489f82` (confirmed via the
    GitHub API against `head=claude/epic-meitner-eh6w1m`) is not a
    descendant of the fix commit `0a0986b` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor
    0a0986b 9800221...` exits 1) — the ancestry evidence in the original
    version of this pass's report belongs to this branch alone, not to the
    `macro-split-decomposition-jalk90` branch above, which is corrected
    there.
  - Run 35539828393 (`claude/intelligent-wright-ebjkn4`, closing the gap the
    2026-09-20 report left open for this branch) failed `Test (Docker)` on
    `examples/saas`'s own
    `create_project_failure_redisplays_the_dashboard_with_name_preserved`
    (`./tests/integration_test.rs:537`) — branch-owned WIP in an unrelated
    example app, not matching any tracked signature.
  - Run 35522888590 (`dependabot/github_actions/dtolnay/rust-toolchain-1.120.0`)
    repeats its already-documented own action-pin-bump break (`SQLite runtime
    (feature=sqlite)`, `MSRV (1.88.0)`) — that PR's own subject matter,
    unmerged.

  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-21T~10:0xZ — **13th** straight
  pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now ~306.8 hours
  idle, past 12.75 days). Still needs a human sign-off for new macOS CI
  spend; not dispatched this pass for that reason.

  2026-09-22T06:24:50Z, fully covers the window with margin on both ends) —
  60 runs in-window: 42 cancelled, 12 success, 6 failure. All 6 triaged at
  job/log level: two `dependabot/cargo/*` branches (`validator-0.21.0`,
  `infer-0.22.0`) repeating the already-documented `fuzz/Cargo.lock`
  `--locked` staleness on `Supply chain (cargo-deny)`, plus
  `validator-0.21.0` also failing `Test (Docker)` on its own subject
  matter (the `validator` 0.21 bump makes `AlgorithmParameters`/`PostForm`
  no longer satisfy `IntoChangeset`'s `Validate` bound in
  `examples/reddit-clone`'s `posts.rs:539`, a genuine compile break from
  that PR's own dependency bump, unmerged); `dependabot/cargo/jsonwebtoken-11.1.0`
  failing `Lint`/`MSRV` from its own bump (jsonwebtoken 11.1's
  `AlgorithmParameters` enum gained a non-exhaustive variant, breaking an
  existing `match` in `autumn/src/auth.rs:1447` — again that PR's own
  subject matter) plus the same `Supply chain` staleness; two runs on
  `claude/bold-heisenberg-t5yxtw` (branch-owned WIP — a `cargo fmt` failure
  on one run, a genuine `autumn-web` lib compile error near
  `autumn/src/auth.rs:804` on the other, both this branch's own in-progress
  diff); and `claude/intelligent-wright-vvhnue`'s `Windows Tier 1 journey`
  job, whose logs 404'd (`get_job_logs` — likely log-retention/eviction,
  not investigated further) — n=1, no matching signature, logged as a gap
  rather than silently assumed branch-owned. None of the 6 match
  `live_upgrade`, `cache_stampede`, `sim_fault_plan`,
  `job_tracking_stores_integration`, or `sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably`.
  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0`, checked
  2026-09-22T~10:1xZ — **14th** straight idle pass (now ~330.5 hours idle,
  past 13.75 days). Still needs a human sign-off for new macOS CI spend;
  not dispatched this pass for that reason.
- **2026-09-23 update — 15th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new hits on any of the three `live_upgrade` signatures.** Sampled
  `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs from the 2026-09-22 report's own cutoff
  (2026-09-22T06:24:50Z, exclusive) to 2026-09-23T07:37:08Z (~25.2h, one
  no-filter `status=completed` query, `perPage=100`/page 1, span
  2026-09-21T18:16:27Z–2026-09-23T07:37:08Z, fully covering the window with
  margin) — 58 `pull_request` runs in-window: 27 success, 24 cancelled, 7
  failure. All 7 triaged (full detail in the `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e`
  entry's own 2026-09-23 update below, not repeated here): one
  `dependabot/github_actions/dtolnay/rust-toolchain-1.120.0` repeat of its
  already-documented action-pin break; five ordinary branch-owned `Lint`/
  `MSRV`/`Diesel migration version collisions` WIP failures across five
  `vesper/bugbash-*` branches (2312, 2363, 2419, 2331, 2311 — see the
  `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e` entry's own update for the corrected
  per-branch breakdown); and one genuine new organic
  hit — but on `sqlite_jobs_scheduler_e2e`, not on any `live_upgrade`,
  `cache_stampede`, or `sim_fault_plan` signature. None of the 7 match this
  entry. **Coverage gap, flagged post-review (via a Codex review comment on
  this update, after the next day's #2942 pass had already established the
  same gap for its own sample): this "zero new hits" finding is scoped to
  the 34 runs that resolved to `success`/`failure` and were actually
  triaged, not a proven-exhaustive zero-hit finding across the full 58-run
  window.** `ci.yml`'s `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true` means a job
  inside one of the 24 `cancelled`-overall runs could still have completed
  with a failing test before the run itself was marked cancelled by a
  superseding push; those runs' job-level logs were not inspected this
  pass. `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0`,
  checked 2026-09-23T~07:5xZ — **15th** straight idle pass (now ~352.9
  hours idle, past 14.7 days). Still needs a human sign-off for new macOS
  CI spend; not dispatched this pass for that reason.
- **2026-09-24 update — 15th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new hits on any of the three `live_upgrade` signatures.** Sampled
  `ci.yml` `pull_request` runs, page 1 of `list_workflow_runs`
  (`event=pull_request`, `status=completed`, `perPage=100`): 100 runs
  spanning 2026-09-22T19:51:14Z–2026-09-24T09:42:24Z (~37.85h) — 64
  cancelled, 32 success, 4 failure. **Coverage gap, recorded rather than
  hidden**: page 2 of the identical query returned runs from
  2026-09-07–2026-09-09 instead of continuing backward from page 1's start,
  and `total_count` itself differed between the two calls (9315 vs. 7616) —
  the API's pagination did not behave as a stable continuation this pass, so
  the ~13.4h gap between this window's start and the 2026-09-22 report's own
  cutoff (2026-09-22T06:24:50Z–19:51:14Z) was not independently sampled.
  **Second coverage gap (post-review, via a Codex review comment on PR
  #2942): only the runs that resolved to `failure` were triaged.** `ci.yml`'s
  `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true` (lines 9-11) means a job inside one
  of the 64 `cancelled`-overall runs could still have completed with a
  failing test before the run itself was marked cancelled by a superseding
  push. Those 64 runs' job-level logs were not inspected this pass, so the
  "zero new hits" findings below are scoped to the 36 runs that resolved to
  `success`/`failure` and were actually checked — not a proven-exhaustive
  zero-hit finding across the full 100-run window (the same caveat this
  ledger's 2026-09-15 update already established as this role's working
  standard when cancelled-run job-level sampling isn't repeated).
  All 4 in-window failures triaged at job/log level:
  - Run 35909966810 (`vesper/bugbash-2881-busy-timeout-shared-cache`,
    `SQLite runtime (feature=sqlite)`, 2026-09-23T19:32:07Z): `E0061`,
    `reject_sqlite_statement_timeout` called with 1 argument instead of 2 at
    `autumn/src/app.rs:11164` and `:11248` — that branch's own in-progress
    statement-timeout work, unmerged, not a flake.
  - Run 35894739084 (`vesper/bugbash-2921-create-project-submit-token`,
    `Lint`/`Test suite`, 2026-09-23T17:18:51Z): `E0308`,
    `extract_submit_token` expects `&str`, given `String`, at
    `examples/saas/tests/integration_test.rs:574` — that branch's own
    submit-token test helper, unmerged, not a flake.
  - Run 35866381449 (`claude/sleepy-brown-7ke3xk`, `SQLite runtime
    (feature=sqlite)`, 2026-09-23T13:20:28Z):
    `sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably` FAILED — the exact
    signature closed above, but this job completed 2026-09-23T13:36:52Z, ~6
    hours **before** PR #2925's merge (`ff406e0`, 2026-09-23T19:33:05Z). The
    same pre-fix occurrence the closed entry's own campaign already
    accounts for, not a new recurrence.
  - Run 35806829348
    (`dependabot/github_actions/dtolnay/rust-toolchain-1.120.0`,
    `MSRV`/`Test (macos-latest)`/`Test (ubuntu-latest)`/
    `Test (windows-latest)`/`Test suite`, 2026-09-23T01:34:17Z): `rustup`
    failed installing toolchain `1.120.0` itself — that PR's own subject
    matter (the pin bump), unmerged.

  None of the 4 match `live_upgrade`, `cache_stampede`, `sim_fault_plan`, or
  any other tracked signature. **`sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably`'s
  fix (PR #2925) is holding**: zero recurrences among the `success`/
  `failure`-concluded runs in the ~14.2h of PR traffic sampled since its
  2026-09-23T19:33:05Z merge, out of this pass's broader ~37.85h window (see
  the closed entry's own 2026-09-24 verification note above, including its
  cancelled-run caveat).

  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-24T~09:5xZ — **15th** straight
  idle pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now ~378.6
  hours idle, past 15.77 days). Still needs a human sign-off for new macOS CI
  spend; not dispatched this pass for that reason.
- **2026-09-25 update — 16th consecutive pass, harness still undispatched;
  zero new hits on any of the three `live_upgrade` signatures, but this
  pass's sampling was dominated by a single unrelated infra outage.**
  `list_workflow_runs(event=pull_request)` at `perPage=100` (with or without
  `status=completed`) consistently returned a stale page (runs from
  2026-09-03/04, not current) this pass, worse than the prior pass's
  page-2 issue — reducing `perPage` to 30 with no `status` filter returned
  current data reliably, at page 1 only (page 2 again jumped back to
  2026-09-03). Sampled that reliable window: 30 `ci.yml` `pull_request`
  runs spanning 2026-09-24T20:21:13Z-2026-09-25T08:05:14Z (~11.7h) — 5
  failures, all 5 triaged at job/log level. **Coverage gap, recorded rather
  than hidden**: the ~10.6h between this window's start and the prior
  pass's own cutoff (2026-09-24T09:42:24Z-20:21:13Z) was not independently
  sampled — the `perPage=100`/`status=completed` staleness left no reliable
  way to reach it this pass. Cancelled runs inside the sampled window were
  also not inspected at job level (same caveat as every prior pass since
  2026-09-15).

  **All 5 failures — plus this repo's own `trunk-dev` push of the prior
  pass's PR (#2942, run 36004498723, completed 2026-09-24T15:32:51Z) — hit
  the identical new signature**, a total, deterministic `quay.io/minio/minio`
  anonymous-pull outage recurring against the fallback registry the closed
  MinIO/Docker-Hub entry's own fix (#2740) switched to; see the new **Open
  entries** section above for the full diagnosis, evidence, and this pass's
  quarantine fix. None of the 6 failures match `live_upgrade`,
  `cache_stampede`, `sim_fault_plan`, `job_tracking_stores_integration`, or
  `sqlite_job_backend_tracks_job_status_durably` — this pass found zero
  organic hits on any of those, but the sample is unusually uninformative
  for that purpose: with `Test (Docker)` failing on essentially every run
  that reached it, a live_upgrade/cache_stampede/sim_fault_plan hit inside
  the same run would still show as a `Test (Docker)`-attributed failure
  unless separately checked — and the failing runs sampled here reached
  their MinIO panic well before the point in the suite those three
  Linux/coverage-shaped signatures fire from, so a concurrent hit hiding
  behind this outage in-window cannot be ruled out from these 6 alone.

  `manual-macos-contention-check.yml`: still `total_count: 0` against
  `workflow_dispatch` runs, checked 2026-09-25T~10:2xZ — **16th** straight
  idle pass since it became dispatchable 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z (now ~403
  hours idle, past 16.8 days). Still needs a human sign-off for new macOS CI
  spend; not dispatched this pass for that reason.
- **Next step**: the Tier 1 load-faithful rerun campaign (10+ fresh
  `macos-latest` VMs, pinned commit, unfiltered `cargo test --workspace`) —
  committed as `.github/workflows/manual-macos-contention-check.yml`, gated
  on a human dispatching it (new macOS CI spend needs sign-off). As shipped
  in #2527 the workflow failed to parse (`jobs.test.if` referenced the
  `matrix` context, which isn't available there — GitHub rejected every
  dispatch attempt with zero jobs run, caught by #2548 but not fixed before
  #2527 merged); fixed in
  `docs/reports/2026-09-08-semaphore-macos-contention-harness-fix.md` (#2627,
  merged 2026-09-08T15:07:44Z) and verified `actionlint`-clean. **About 19
  hours later, it still has zero `workflow_dispatch` runs** (`total_count: 0`
  against the workflow's own run history, checked 2026-09-09T10:20Z) —
  nobody has dispatched it yet. (The workflow *file* has existed since
  2026-09-05, so it is four days old, but it only became dispatchable —
  i.e. actually able to run — when #2627 fixed its parse error; don't
  conflate the file's total age with how long the working version has been
  available.) That gap is now more urgent given the new Linux hit above
  widens what the
  campaign needs to test (not macOS-only; ideally a Linux `Coverage
  (workspace)`-shaped rerun too, not just `cargo test --workspace` on a
  plain runner). #2548 separately banked 13/13 clean organic macOS samples
  on the tracked corpus since #2510 merged — reassuring, still short of the
  ≥20 (≥50 for the sub-10% end) sample size this role's own evidentiary bar
  calls for before treating an entry as closed — and per the corrected math
  in the 2026-09-10 update above, 3/30 (10%, not below it) puts this
  specific cluster on the ≥20 side of that split, not ≥50. (That specific
  numeric threshold is Semaphore's own operating standard, not a field
  defined in
  this ledger's intake form above — the intake form's own requirement is
  just a same-commit rerun-rate baseline, `<k>/<n>`, with no minimum `n`
  written into it.)
- **A fix has already landed** (PR #2510, merged 2026-09-05T20:25:01Z) that
  reclassifies `ECONNRESET`/`ECONNABORTED` (retryable) separately from
  `ECONNREFUSED` (hard zero-tolerance failure) — this is the change behind
  today's `refused == 0` / `hard == 0` split at lines 520-528 referenced
  above. But per its own description it could not be verified against a
  real macOS run at merge time, so it still does not carry the before/after
  rerun evidence this role's evidentiary bar calls for, and it would not
  address the new line-567 signature above regardless (different assertion
  entirely). Track it against the rerun campaign above before treating this
  entry as resolved — "merged" is not the same as "verified."
- **2026-09-28 update — another organic hit, same tracked line-686
  signature, `Coverage (workspace)`/Linux.** Run 36393954592
  (`claude/busy-cerf-qydnb2`, PR #2987, job id 108869635633, completed
  2026-09-28T09:46:33Z): `test result: FAILED. 5 passed; 1 failed` in
  `live_upgrade.rs`, panic at
  `examples/hot-upgrade/tests/live_upgrade.rs:686:5` (the exact site
  already tracked above, run through `MultiThread::block_on` this time —
  the triggering PR's own commit switched an unrelated test,
  `search_plugin_integration`, to a multi-thread runtime to fix a
  different, already-diagnosed deadlock; `live_upgrade`'s own harness was
  untouched by that PR and this is a coincidental same-day neighbor, not a
  side effect of that fix). Not campaigned this pass (still no
  CI-native rerun harness dispatched for this signature — same gap the
  2026-09-10 update above already named). Recorded as a data point only;
  no new mechanism claim beyond what is already tracked.

### `cache_stampede::swr_serves_stale_and_refreshes_in_background`

- **Observed**: 1/17 `macos-latest` executions, organic sample, 2026-09-03.
  A *different* assertion (line 501, publish-visibility poll) than the one
  already hardened for a documented `windows-latest` flake in #1809 — same
  test, two different timing-sensitive assertions on two different
  non-Linux platforms.
- **Second organic hit, 2026-09-09 — now a repeat signature, not a
  one-off**: run 34297324354 (branch `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0`),
  job `Test (macos-latest)`, same test, same assertion, same line:
  `autumn/tests/integration/cache_stampede.rs:501:6`, `"background refresh
  must publish the new value after it finishes computing"`. Six days apart,
  same exact panic site, both on `macos-latest` — this is no longer
  "suggestive," it is a confirmed-repeat failure signature. Still not a
  formal rerun-rate (organic sample only, denominator not tracked as
  tightly as the 2026-09-04 census's), so still below the ≥20/≥50 sample
  size this role's own evidentiary bar (not the intake form) calls for
  before a fix PR, but it should be weighted at least as high as
  `live_upgrade` for the next rerun campaign, not treated as the minor
  entry it was when it had n=1.
- **Status**: under active investigation, same rerun campaign as
  `live_upgrade` above (still undispatched).
- **2026-09-14 update**: no repeat in the ~23h window sampled this pass (see
  the `live_upgrade` entry's dated update above for the window and method).

  (see the `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-15 dated update above for the

  sampling was not repeated this pass).

  dominated every in-window failure and left the sample less informative
  than usual for this signature specifically).

### `sim_fault_plan::same_seed_replays_a_byte_identical_outcome_100_times`

- **Observed**: 1/17 `macos-latest` executions, organic sample, 2026-09-03.
  Panic: `"job runtime is not initialized; register jobs with
  AppBuilder::jobs()"` — reads as a setup/shared-state defect (the test
  runs under `job::global_job_runtime_test_lock`, a process-global lock),
  not an exhausted wall-clock wait.
- **Status**: one occurrence — suggestive, not yet a repeat signature.
  Covered by the same rerun campaign as `live_upgrade` above.
- **2026-09-14 update**: no repeat in the ~23h window sampled this pass (see
  the `live_upgrade` entry's dated update above for the window and method).
  Still n=1, still not campaigned.

  (see the `live_upgrade` entry's 2026-09-15 dated update above for the
  window and method — including the caveat that cancelled-run job-level
  sampling was not repeated this pass). A related sibling test with a
  different name, `sim_fault_plan_pg::fail_db_checkout_fires_on_the_target_ordinal_under_transactional_isolation`,
  passed in the same `Test (Docker)` run that hit the
  `job_tracking_stores_integration` repeat below — positive evidence, not
  absence, for that one run. Still n=1, still not campaigned.

### (quay.io, 2026-09-25) `offsite_backup::offsite_backup_upload_then_restore_round_trips` / `offsite_backup::offsite_backup_uploads_large_artifact_via_multipart` / `sqlite_replication_s3::replicates_to_and_restores_from_a_real_s3_endpoint`

- **Quarantined**: 2026-09-25 in #2953.
- **Owner**: @madmax983 (repo owner) — the fix needs a business/infra decision
  (pay for authenticated `quay.io` pulls, or stand up and maintain a
  self-hosted/mirrored MinIO image) that this role cannot make unilaterally
  per its own "ask before: new CI spend" rule. Not the person who diagnosed
  it (this pass); the person on the hook for the remediation decision.
- **Diagnose-by**: N/A — mechanism is confirmed, not pending (see below).
  **Revisit-by**: 2026-10-02 — check whether `quay.io/minio/minio` anonymous
  pulls have been restored, or whether a decision has been made, before this
  entry goes stale.
- **Rerun-rate baseline**: not applicable in the stochastic sense — this is a
  deterministic, 100% external-dependency outage, not a flake. 6/6 `Test
  (Docker)` failures carry the identical signature in the ~12h window sampled
  before this quarantine (2026-09-24T20:21:13Z-2026-09-25T09:09Z): 5
  independent PRs (`claude/tender-galileo-q43orv`, `claude/busy-cerf-0i7k5y`,
  `claude/friendly-ritchie-nv7uw7`, `claude/wizardly-wright-dyva9u`,
  `claude/brave-goldberg-h3c4cr`) plus this repo's own `trunk-dev` push of the
  2026-09-24 Semaphore follow-up (#2942, run 36004498723, a docs-only ledger
  PR with zero code changes — confirming the failure tracks the external
  dependency, not any PR's own diff). No PR in the sampled window that
  reached the `Test (Docker)` job passed it.
- **Failure signature**: panic `` start MinIO — is Docker running?:
  Client(PullImage { descriptor: "quay.io/minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z",
  err: DockerResponseServerError { status_code: 500, message: "unauthorized:
  access to the requested resource is not authorized" } }) `` at
  `autumn-cli/tests/integration/offsite_backup.rs:82:10` (and the identical
  shape at `autumn/tests/integration/sqlite_replication_s3.rs`'s own
  `MinIO::default()` call site).
- **Mechanism**: unpinned/vanished external dependency — the same category as
  the closed MinIO/Docker-Hub entry above, recurring against the fallback
  that entry's own fix (#2740) switched to. Confirmed directly, not inferred
  from the CI error text alone: an anonymous `quay.io/v2/auth` token request
  for `repository:minio/minio:pull` succeeds (200) but the returned JWT's
  `access` grant carries `"actions":[]` — empty, no `pull` — and a manifest
  GET against `quay.io/v2/minio/minio/manifests/RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z`
  with that token still 401s (`www-authenticate: Bearer ...`). The identical
  probe against an unrelated public quay.io repo, `quay.io/prometheus/prometheus`,
  returns a normal 200 with a real manifest — so this is scoped to
  `minio/minio` specifically, not a quay.io-wide policy change or outage.
  MinIO Inc.'s own repository page (`quay.io/repository/minio/minio`, the web
  UI, not the registry API) still returns 200, so the repository exists and
  is browsable; only anonymous registry pulls are cut off. This is the same
  vendor that deleted its Docker Hub org outright in October 2025 (see the
  closed entry above) now also closing off the last public registry this
  repo's tests depended on.
- **Test-vs-product**: neither — pure external CI/test infrastructure
  dependency (a third-party vendor's container distribution policy), no
  product code path is implicated, the same classification as every other
  "unpinned external service" entry in this ledger.
- **Remediation attempted, not found**: searched for a still-anonymously-pullable
  MinIO-compatible replacement image before quarantining rather than after.
  `docker.io/minio/minio` remains gone (the October 2025 org deletion, see
  above — not re-checked in depth this pass since nothing suggests it
  returned). `docker.io/bitnami/minio`: Docker Hub's own repository API
  reports it `"is_private": false` and `"status": "active"` with 58M+
  historical pulls, but its registry tags list (`GET
  /v2/bitnami/minio/tags/list`, both with and without a token, and via
  `hub.docker.com`'s own tags API) returns zero tags — consistent with
  Broadcom's 2025 Bitnami Secure Images move, which pulled free-tier tags
  behind a paid catalog while leaving the repository shell/description in
  place. `ghcr.io/minio/minio` and `public.ecr.aws/minio/minio` both 401.
  No further candidates were tried this pass. A working replacement, if one
  exists, was not found by registry-probing alone — this may need the
  vendor's own current documentation (unavailable to check further in this
  pass) or a self-hosted mirror.
- **Fix, not applied — quarantined instead, per the "ask before: new CI
  spend" rule and because no Docker daemon is available in this sandbox to
  verify a replacement image's compatibility with `testcontainers_modules::minio::MinIO`'s
  wait strategy and env-var expectations before committing to one.** Swapping
  registries blind, a second time, risks repeating the multi-PR collision
  the first swap caused (see the escape entry above) — and this time there
  is no confirmed working target to swap to. Instead: `--skip
  offsite_backup_upload_then_restore_round_trips --skip
  offsite_backup_uploads_large_artifact_via_multipart` added to `ci.yml`'s
  `cli_tests` bare `--ignored` sweep, and `--skip
  replicates_to_and_restores_from_a_real_s3_endpoint` added to the
  `integration_tests` sweep — both by exact test name, the same convention
  this repo already uses for the non-Docker generator-conformance skips in
  the same block (CLAUDE.md's "Docker / testcontainer DB tests run
  automatically in CI" section). This is quarantine, not deletion: the tests
  are untouched, still compile, and still run for anyone with Docker and
  working `quay.io` credentials locally.
- **Not covered by this quarantine**: `examples/reddit-clone/tests/avatar_s3_integration.rs`'s
  `avatar_blob_store_roundtrip` — same `MinIO::default().with_name(MINIO_IMAGE)`
  call site, same outage, but (per the closed MinIO entry above) this test
  was never part of either CI Docker sweep to begin with, so no `ci.yml`
  change is needed to stop it from failing CI; it simply fails identically
  whenever anyone runs it directly.
- **Impact while open**: this fails the required `Test (Docker)` job — and
  therefore the required `Test suite` (`test-gate`) aggregator — on every PR
  whose run reaches that job, independent of the PR's own diff, until this
  quarantine merges. Given the ~12h/6-for-6 sampling above, that was
  effectively every PR reaching the Docker sweep in that window.
- **Linked issue/PR**: none filed separately — tracked here and in #2953,
  which is the fix (the quarantine) as well as the diagnosis.
- **Skip mechanism**: `ci.yml`'s `cli_tests` and `integration_tests` bare
  `--ignored` sweeps, `--skip <exact test name>`, chosen over `#[ignore]`ing
  the test bodies themselves so the quarantine is visible and reversible in
  one place (this ledger entry names both `ci.yml` lines) rather than
  scattered across test source files.
- **Resolution**: switched every `MinIO` call site to Chainguard's free
  `cgr.dev/chainguard/minio` image, pinned by digest, and removed the three
  `--skip` lines. It is the upstream `minio` binary with the same entrypoint,
  so `testcontainers_modules::minio::MinIO`'s command, `minioadmin`
  credentials and wait strategy work unchanged. The image has no `EXPOSE`, so
  each call site publishes port 9000 with `.with_mapped_port(0, 9000.tcp())`.
  Anonymous pulls need no
  account or secret. Chainguard's free tier serves only the `latest` tag, but
  it keeps old digests pullable, so the pin holds. Verified by running all
  three tests plus the reddit-clone avatar test against a local Docker daemon
  before the push. Candidates that failed an anonymous pull on 2026-09-26:
  `quay.io/minio/minio` (401), `docker.io/minio/minio` (gone),
  `ghcr.io/minio/minio` (denied), `mirror.gcr.io/minio/minio` (not found).
  `docker.io/bitnamilegacy/minio` pulls, but it is frozen and has a different
  entrypoint.
- **Closed**: 2026-09-26, in the PR that restores the tests.
### `Windows Tier 1 journey`: `autumn setup` fails "✗ Failed to read cargo metadata" against a freshly-scaffolded app

- **New, 2026-09-27. n=2 organic, identical signature, ~32h apart, on two
  unrelated branches.** Run 108204416273 (`vesper/bugbash-2288-commentable-author-name`,
  2026-09-25T18:52:29Z) and run 108534929493 (`vesper/bugbash-2415-multipart-type-case`,
  2026-09-27T02:41:46Z) both fail the `Windows Tier 1 journey` job's `autumn
  setup` step against the scaffolded `tier1_app`, immediately after the
  preceding `autumn doctor` step completed normally (29 passed/4 warned/1
  failed — only the expected pre-setup `tailwind_binary` warning). Identical
  output both times: `✗ Failed to read cargo metadata`, then the PowerShell
  wrapper's `if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "autumn setup failed with
  $LASTEXITCODE" }` step throws `autumn setup failed with 1`. Neither
  triggering branch's own diff touches Windows-specific code, `autumn setup`,
  or `autumn-cli`'s cargo-metadata helpers — both are unrelated feature
  branches (a `commentable` author-name fix, a multipart type-case fix).
- **Mechanism: unconfirmed — this is itself the finding.** `autumn setup`
  (via `autumn-cli/src/build.rs:875`'s `read_cargo_metadata`, and the near-
  identical helpers at `autumn-cli/src/routes.rs:280`/`autumn-cli/src/dev.rs:1916`)
  ran `cargo metadata --format-version=1 --no-deps`, got a non-zero exit, and
  the CI log shows only the helper's own generic `"✗ Failed to read cargo
  metadata"` — **`cargo`'s own stderr was never captured or printed**, so
  neither occurrence's actual cause (network/index-fetch failure resolving
  the scaffolded app's fresh `Cargo.toml`, a disk/permission issue on the
  Windows runner, a stale/inconsistent lockfile, or something else) is
  visible in either run's log. This is the same class of gap the ledger
  already flagged once before for this exact job (2026-09-22 update to the
  `live_upgrade` entry's neighbor list: `claude/intelligent-wright-vvhnue`'s
  `Windows Tier 1 journey` failure, whose logs 404'd and were "not
  investigated further" — a different proximate cause, but the same
  "Windows Tier 1 journey failed and nobody could see why" shape) — except
  this time the log is readable and the helper itself, not log retention, is
  what's hiding the cause.
- **Test-vs-product: not yet renderable — the missing stderr is exactly what
  a verdict needs.** `cargo metadata` failing against a scaffold this job
  generates fresh every run could be a real product defect (something the
  scaffolded `autumn.toml`/`Cargo.toml` template produces that `cargo`
  rejects only intermittently, e.g. under Windows path-length or antivirus-
  lock contention) or pure CI/runner infrastructure (a transient crates.io-
  index fetch failure, disk pressure) — the two are indistinguishable from
  the generic message alone, and guessing which is exactly the folklore this
  role's own rules ban ("CI is flaky" is not a mechanism).
- **Treatment, this pass: an observability fix, not a flake fix — the
  distinction this role's own gate exists to enforce.** No rerun campaign, no
  tolerance change, no retry. `read_cargo_metadata`/`find_binary_in_profile`/
  `cargo_metadata` (`build.rs`, `routes.rs`, `dev.rs`) now print
  `String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr)` alongside the existing message
  before exiting, so the next occurrence's actual `cargo` error lands in the
  CI log instead of being discarded. `try_cargo_metadata`
  (`dev.rs:1933`, the deliberately-silent best-effort path used by lifecycle
  commands like `autumn serve stop`) is untouched — printing there would
  defeat its own documented purpose of staying quiet on a broken manifest.
  Verified with `cargo check -p autumn-cli`, `cargo fmt -p autumn-cli --
  --check`, and `cargo clippy -p autumn-cli --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  all clean; no Windows runner available in this sandbox to reproduce the
  original failure directly.
- **Status**: open, n=2, mechanism unconfirmed. Not quarantined — `Windows
  Tier 1 journey` keeps running on every PR unchanged; this only changes
  what the next failure's log shows. Revisit once a third occurrence lands
  with the new stderr output captured, or after ~2 weeks with zero repeats.
- **Linked issue/PR**: none filed separately yet — the observability fix
  lands directly in this ledger's own tracking PR, per this repo's
  established convention for a diagnosability gap found mid-triage.
- **Skip mechanism**: none — this is a tracked signature, not a quarantine.
- **2026-09-28 update — mechanism confirmed, n=2→n=4, fix applied this
  pass.** The stderr fix (#2973, merged 2026-09-27) paid off immediately:
  two more organic occurrences, run 108821476268
  (`vesper/bugbash-2662-parent-pk-override`, 2026-09-28T07:08:33Z) and run
  108842089677 (`vesper/bugbash-2445-capacity-probe-count`,
  2026-09-28T08:18:57Z), ~70 minutes apart on two unrelated branches, both
  now show the actual `cargo` error the generic message was hiding:
  ```
  ✗ Failed to read cargo metadata
  error: the 'cargo.exe' binary, normally provided by the 'cargo' component, is not applicable to the '1.88.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc' toolchain
  ```
  Identical text both times.

  **Mechanism, confirmed by source, not just the error string.** Every
  scaffolded app's `rust-toolchain.toml` pins `channel = "1.88.0"`
  literally — `autumn-cli/src/templates/rust-toolchain.toml.tmpl`:
  `channel = "{{rust_version}}"`, substituted from `Cargo.toml`'s
  `rust-version = "1.88.0"` (`autumn-cli/src/new.rs:227`,
  `option_env!("CARGO_PKG_RUST_VERSION").unwrap_or("1.88.0")`) — a
  *different* rustup toolchain identity than `"stable"`. The
  `windows-tier1` job's own toolchain-install step
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, before this pass's fix) was
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`, which installs and names the toolchain
  `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, not `1.88.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` —
  even though `stable` currently resolves to rustc 1.88.0 (confirmed by
  both failing runs' own `autumn doctor` output immediately above the
  failure: `"rust_toolchain"` check passes with `"rustc 1.88.0 ≥ MSRV
  1.88.0"`), rustup treats them as two distinct named toolchains. The
  first `cargo`/`autumn` invocation inside the freshly-scaffolded
  `tier1_app` directory (`autumn setup`, which shells out to `cargo
  metadata` per `autumn-cli/src/build.rs:875`'s `read_cargo_metadata`) hits
  that directory's `rust-toolchain.toml` override and makes rustup
  auto-install the separate `1.88.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain on
  the fly — a network operation happening implicitly mid-command, with no
  dedicated CI step, no retry, and no log visibility of its own. The `msrv`
  job elsewhere in `ci.yml` avoids exactly this by installing
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.88.0` directly; `windows-tier1` never did.
  `"cargo.exe binary... not applicable to the toolchain"` is a known
  rustup failure shape for a toolchain whose on-disk contents don't match
  what its manifest claims — consistent with an on-demand install that
  raced or partially completed under the same job that is simultaneously
  building the full `autumn-web`/`managed-pg-bundled` dependency graph
  (the LNK4318/PDB-limit comments already in this job's `env:` block
  describe how resource-constrained this exact job already runs).

  **Test-vs-product verdict: CI/build infrastructure, not a product or
  test defect.** Nothing about `autumn setup`'s own logic, the scaffold's
  generated `rust-toolchain.toml`, or the app it builds is wrong — pinning
  the exact MSRV in every scaffolded project is deliberate, correct
  behavior (the same file the `rust_toolchain_pins_channel_to_msrv` unit
  test in `autumn-cli/src/new.rs` guards). The defect is entirely in this
  one CI job's own toolchain provisioning: it installs `stable` for
  itself and then lets a *different* pinned toolchain get resolved
  implicitly, mid-journey, with no explicit install step.

  **Fix, applied this pass**: `windows-tier1`'s toolchain step changed from
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` to `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.88.0` —
  installing the exact toolchain the scaffolded app's own
  `rust-toolchain.toml` will later request, so rustup never needs to
  auto-install anything once the journey begins. This mirrors the `msrv`
  job's own existing pattern one line above it in the same file, not a new
  convention. No retry, no timeout change, no tolerance widened — the
  on-demand install path is removed rather than made more forgiving.
  Comment added at the change site records this diagnosis and the four
  run IDs for the next person who touches this job.
  **Verification**: `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"`
  confirms the edited `ci.yml` is still valid YAML; `actionlint` was not
  available in this sandbox. No Windows runner available locally to
  reproduce the original failure or to pre-verify the fix, so **CI-native
  verification was pending this PR's own `Windows Tier 1 journey` run**,
  the same posture already used for the `postgresql_embedded`
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` entry above. Revert check: not applicable in the rerun
  sense (nothing about the scaffolded app's behavior changes on the
  success path), but reverting the toolchain-pin edit would restore the
  exact on-demand-install path all four occurrences hit.

  **CI-native confirmation, same day**: PR #2994's own `Windows Tier 1
  journey` run (job 108894563658, part of workflow run 36409451738)
  completed `success` at 2026-09-28T11:05:23Z against head `6f47775` — the
  first run of this job to install `@1.88.0` up front. No on-demand
  toolchain install, no `cargo.exe`/toolchain error, journey completed
  clean end to end. Separately, a Codex review comment on #2994 caught a
  real gap in this fix's own durability: `scripts/check-msrv.sh` only
  checked that *some* line in `ci.yml` pinned the canonical MSRV (already
  satisfied by the `msrv` job alone), so a future MSRV bump could update
  `Cargo.toml` and the `msrv` job while leaving `windows-tier1` on a stale
  pin, silently reopening this exact race. Fixed in the same PR
  (`6f47775`): the script now checks `windows-tier1`'s own job block for
  the canonical pin specifically, verified to fail when that pin is
  reverted to `@stable` and to pass on the current file.
  **Status**: n=4 organic, mechanism confirmed by source + stderr, fix
  applied and **CI-natively confirmed** on #2994's own head (open, CI-green,
  awaiting human review/merge as of this update). Drift-guard added to
  `check-msrv.sh` so a future MSRV bump can't silently reopen the race.
  Treat as closed once #2994 merges; revisit only if a fifth occurrence
  lands on `trunk-dev` after that.


  **Update 2026-09-29 — the pin was incomplete; 5th occurrence, new
  signature.** Workflow run 36460138986 (job 109065947467,
  `claude/epic-meitner-ageu82`, 2026-09-28T18:15Z), run *after* #2994 landed
  on trunk and with `@1.88.0` verifiably installed up front, failed the same
  step with a different rustup error:
  `error: failed to install component: 'rustfmt-preview-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc', detected conflict: 'bin\cargo-fmt.exe'`.
  **Mechanism**: `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` installs `--profile minimal`, while
  the scaffolded app's `rust-toolchain.toml` requests
  `components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]`, so `autumn setup`'s first `cargo
  metadata` still triggers an implicit, un-retried component install on a
  loaded Windows runner — the same on-demand-install class #2994 targeted,
  one level down. **Verdict**: CI provisioning, not product/test. **Fix**:
  `components: rustfmt, clippy` on the job's toolchain step. Not
  quarantined. CI-native verification pending this PR's own `Windows Tier 1
  journey` run; a single pass is anecdote, so this entry stays open until
  the job has run clean on several subsequent PRs. Reverting the
  `components:` line restores the exact failing path.
