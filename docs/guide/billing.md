# Billing: Stripe subscriptions and dunning (`autumn-billing`)

`autumn-billing` adds subscription billing to an Autumn app: hosted checkout, the
customer portal, a webhook-fed local mirror of billing state, a plan gate for
handlers, and durable retries for failed payments. Stripe ships first behind a
provider-neutral `BillingProvider` trait.

- **Crate:** `autumn-billing`
- **Issue:** [#1190](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues/1190)
- **Builds on:** `SignedWebhook` (verified intake), `#[job]` (durable
  retries), the notification store (#1148), `plugin_migrations` (mirror tables).

---

## 1. Install

```bash
autumn plugin add autumn-billing
```

Set the keys in the environment:

```bash
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

Declare the webhook receiver in `autumn.toml`. `SignedWebhook` verifies the
signature and rejects replays; CSRF exempts the path because it is declared
here:

```toml
[[security.webhooks.endpoints]]
name = "billing"
path = "/billing/webhook"
provider = "stripe"
secret_env = "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
max_body_bytes = 4194304
```

The 4 MiB limit is not optional: invoices with many lines exceed the 1 MiB
framework default, and a body over the declared limit becomes a 400 that
Stripe retries unchanged, so the event never reaches reconciliation. Boot
fails if the declared endpoint allows less.

Boot fails with this exact snippet when the endpoint is missing.

## 2. Mount

```rust,ignore
use autumn_billing::prelude::*;

let billing = BillingConfig::from_autumn_toml("autumn.toml")?;
let plans = PlanCatalog::new().plan(
    Plan::new("pro", "Pro", "price_123", Money::from_minor(1999, Currency::USD), BillingInterval::Month)
        .entitlement("export"),
);

autumn_web::app()
    .plugin(BillingPlugin::new().config(billing).plans(&plans))
    .run()
    .await;
```

Plans can also live in TOML:

```toml
[billing]
success_url = "/billing/success"
cancel_url = "/billing/cancel"
portal_return_url = "/account"

[[billing.plans]]
id = "pro"
name = "Pro"
price_id = "price_123"
amount_minor = 1999
currency = "USD"
interval = "month"
entitlements = ["export"]
```

The plugin registers its migration through `plugin_migrations`; the next
`autumn migrate` creates `billing_customers`, `billing_subscriptions`,
`billing_invoices`, `billing_events` and `billing_dunning`. A partial unique
index on `billing_customers.user_id` keeps one customer per user when two
checkouts race. Without a database pool the plugin falls back to an in-memory
mirror that is lost on restart; a production profile refuses to boot on it
unless `billing.allow_memory_store_in_production = true`. Production also
requires `billing.stripe.api_base` to start with `https://`.

## 3. Routes

| Method | Path                    | Purpose                                                  |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/billing/checkout`     | `{ "plan": "pro" }` → 303 to hosted checkout (JSON: `{ "url", "id" }`); 404 unknown plan |
| POST   | `/billing/portal`       | 303 to the hosted billing portal                         |
| GET    | `/billing/subscription` | Current subscription + plan from the local mirror        |
| POST   | `/billing/webhook`      | Signed provider webhook receiver                         |

Checkout and portal need a logged-in session (401 otherwise). Checkout returns
409 when the user already has a live subscription. Redirect URLs come from
config only. `GET /billing/subscription` never calls the provider.

## 4. Gate a handler

```rust,ignore
use autumn_billing::prelude::*;

struct Pro;
impl PlanRequirement for Pro {
    fn rule() -> PlanRule { PlanRule::plan("pro") }
}

#[get("/reports")]
async fn reports(_pro: Entitled<Pro>) -> &'static str { "ok" }
```

`Entitled<R>` runs before the body is read: 401 without a session user, 403
without an entitled subscription. Inside a handler or a `Policy`, use the
service form:

```rust,ignore
async fn export(billing: Billing, session: Session) -> AutumnResult<&'static str> {
    let user = billing.current_user(&session).await.map_err(BillingError::into_autumn)?;
    billing.require(&user, &PlanRule::entitlement("export")).await.map_err(BillingError::into_autumn)?;
    Ok("csv")
}
```

`Billing::current_user` reads the user id with the app's configured auth
session key and answers 401 when nobody is logged in.

Entitled means: status `active` or `trialing` (`past_due` only with
`allow_past_due`), the price maps to a catalog plan, and
`current_period_end + grace_period` is not in the past. The grace period
(default 72 h) bounds how long a dead webhook keeps a lapsed customer entitled.
When no period end is known the deadline is `last_event_at + grace_period`.
Everything else is denied.

## 5. The mirror and idempotency

The provider is the source of truth. Every webhook event is claimed in
`billing_events` by its provider event id before it is applied, so a
redelivered event applies once. Upserts carry the provider event time: an older
event never overwrites newer state, a same-instant conflict resolves to the
higher-ranked status, and a canceled subscription is terminal. A failure after
the claim releases it, so the provider's redelivery applies again.

## 6. Dunning

`invoice.payment_failed` opens a row in `billing_dunning` and enqueues the
`autumn_billing_dunning_retry` job at the first retry time. The row is the
schedule; the job only carries the invoice id and reads the row, so a duplicate
run, an early run, or a restart is safe. On startup the plugin re-arms every
open row and prunes applied ledger rows older than 30 days. A row left
`running` by a crashed process is reclaimed 10 minutes after its last update.
Each retry asks the provider to collect the invoice again with a stable
idempotency key:

- paid → `recovered`, notification `billing.payment_recovered`
- declined → next retry, notification `billing.payment_failed`
- declined after the last retry → subscription `unpaid` in the mirror first,
  then `cancel_subscription` at the provider (`ExhaustionAction::MarkUnpaid`
  skips the cancel), notification `billing.dunning_exhausted`
- transport error → the same attempt is rescheduled 15 minutes later and the
  job returns `Ok`; the schedule row stays the truth and is never dead-lettered

Defaults: three retries. The first retry runs 1 day after the failure, the
second 3 days after that, the third 5 days after that (days 1, 4 and 9).
Stripe's own Smart Retries would run in parallel; turn them off in the Stripe
dashboard, or keep them and mount `DunningPolicy::disabled()` so the plugin
only mirrors and notifies.

Notifications go to the in-app notification store. The recipient is
`BillingHooks::recipient_for(user_id)` for the customer's linked user; the
default parses a numeric id. Returning `None` suppresses the notification.

| Kind                            | Payload fields                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `billing.payment_failed`        | `invoice_id`, `provider_invoice_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount_due`, `attempt`, `provider_attempt_count`, `reason` |
| `billing.payment_recovered`     | `invoice_id`, `provider_invoice_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount_paid`                               |
| `billing.dunning_exhausted`     | `invoice_id`, `provider_invoice_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount_due`, `attempts`, `action`          |
| `billing.subscription_canceled` | `subscription_id`, `provider_subscription_id`, `plan_id`                                            |

`attempt` is the number of the retry the plugin scheduled (`null` when dunning
is disabled). `reason` is the provider decline reason, when known.

## 7. Money

`Money` holds `i64` minor units and a `Currency`; read them with `minor()` and
`currency()`. Amounts are integer minor units; `Money::from_decimal` and
`to_decimal` bridge to `rust_decimal::Decimal` exactly. The crate contains no
`f32` or `f64` (a test enforces it).

## 8. Testing

`cargo test -p autumn-billing` runs every flow in process with a fake provider
and signed Stripe fixtures. `cargo test -p autumn-billing --test mirror_db --
--ignored` runs the database store against a Postgres testcontainer.
