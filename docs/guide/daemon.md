# Daemon mode: `autumn serve`

`autumn serve` runs your app as a long-lived **local daemon** — a personal
service a thin CLI or an agent talks to (the shape of ollama, syncthing, or a
local MCP server). It is the production, non-watch counterpart to
[`autumn dev`](./getting-started.md): no file watching, no hot reload, plus a
managed lifecycle and a no-fuss local database story.

> **Windows:** the whole lifecycle runs natively, and can be registered as a
> Windows service that starts at boot and restarts after a crash. The contract is
> the same; the transport and the stop signal are not. See
> [Windows](#windows) below.

## Quick start

```sh
# A zero-dependency daemon (no database):
autumn new mytool --daemon
cd mytool
autumn serve --daemon      # build + start in the background
autumn serve status        # running (pid 4242) on unix:/run/user/1000/autumn/mytool/serve.sock
autumn serve stop          # graceful drain, then remove socket/pidfile
```

Time from `autumn new --daemon` to a running, reachable daemon is well under
two minutes with **zero externally-installed dependencies**.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `autumn serve` | Build and run in the foreground (Ctrl-C drains and stops). |
| `autumn serve --release` | Build an optimized release binary first. |
| `autumn serve --daemon` | Build and run detached in the background. |
| `autumn serve status` | `running (pid, address)` (exit 0) or `stopped` (exit 3). |
| `autumn serve stop` | Graceful drain, then a force-kill of the process tree on timeout. |
| `autumn serve restart` | `stop` (if running) then `--daemon`. |
| `autumn serve install-service` | Windows only: register the daemon as a boot-start, crash-restarting service. |
| `autumn serve uninstall-service` | Windows only: stop it, deregister it, remove its state. |

A second `--daemon` start is **rejected** with a clear message rather than
double-binding, guarded by a PID lockfile.

## Transport and discovery

On Unix the daemon binds a **Unix domain socket** (mode `0600`), never a public
interface; on Windows it binds its configured `server.host` / `server.port` (see
[Windows](#windows)). Either way a client discovers where from a small TOML file
beside the pidfile:

```toml
# <runtime-dir>/<project>/serve.addr
pid = 4242
transport = "unix"
address = "/run/user/1000/autumn/mytool/serve.sock"
started_at = 1750000000
managed_pg = false
```

To bind a socket from a plain `.run()` app (without the CLI), set
`server.unix_socket` in `autumn.toml` or `AUTUMN_SERVER__UNIX_SOCKET`. Leave it
unset to bind TCP on `server.host:server.port` (default `127.0.0.1:3000`).

## Where state lives

PID lockfile, socket, address file, and logs live under platform-appropriate
directories — XDG (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, `$XDG_STATE_HOME`) on
Linux, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%APPDATA%`/`%LOCALAPPDATA%` on
Windows — never the current directory, `/tmp`, or `/etc`. Set
`AUTUMN_RUNTIME_DIR` to override the base (used in tests).

Access is restricted to you. On Unix the directories are `0700` and the files
`0600`. Windows has no mode bits, so the directories get the equivalent ACL —
your account (by SID, so it resolves on a domain-joined or Entra-joined machine
too), `SYSTEM` and the local `Administrators` group, with inheritance broken so
nothing wider leaks in from a parent directory. Everything created inside (the
log, the address file, the managed-Postgres cluster) inherits it. Autumn also
takes ownership of the directory, because an object's owner can rewrite its ACL
no matter what it says. If any of that cannot be applied — including on a
directory another user already owns — the daemon **refuses to start** rather
than run with its records reachable by other local users.

On Windows this is `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, never roaming `%APPDATA%`: a pidfile is
machine-specific, and a managed-Postgres cluster must not be synced at logoff or
placed on a redirected network share.

## Windows

The lifecycle runs natively: `--daemon`, `stop`, `status` and `restart` behave
as they do on Unix, with a single-instance guard, a readiness-gated start, the
same `serve.addr` discovery file, and the same `status` exit codes (0 running,
3 stopped). Three things differ, because the platforms differ.

**Transport.** There is no Unix socket, so a Windows daemon binds its configured
`server.host` / `server.port` — which is also what you want when the point is to
self-host the app. It reports the address it actually bound back to the CLI,
which records it:

```toml
# %LOCALAPPDATA%\autumn\<project>\data\run\serve.addr   (never Roaming)
pid = 4242
transport = "tcp"
address = "127.0.0.1:3000"
```

`autumn serve status` prints `tcp:127.0.0.1:3000` where Unix prints
`unix:/run/.../serve.sock`. A client reads the transport and address from the
same two fields either way.

**Stop.** Windows has no `SIGTERM`. `autumn serve stop` asks for the drain by
creating `serve.stop`, which the daemon watches (the app is started with
`AUTUMN_SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL_FILE` pointing at it). That runs the *identical*
sequence a signal runs: readiness flips to draining, the prestop grace elapses,
in-flight requests finish, `on_shutdown` hooks run — so a managed Postgres child
is stopped cleanly, not orphaned. Only once the daemon's recorded budget expires
does `stop` escalate, and then it force-kills the whole process tree rather than
just the app.

A foreground `autumn serve` also drains on a console control event —
`CTRL_C` and `CTRL_BREAK` run the full graceful path, and `CTRL_CLOSE`,
`CTRL_LOGOFF` and `CTRL_SHUTDOWN` start it. Be aware of what the last three
really buy: Windows *tells* a process about them rather than asking, and the
grace period applies to the handler, not to the work the handler starts — so a
drain longer than a second or two will lose that race. **Stop an Autumn app
through `autumn serve stop` or the Service Control Manager**, both of which wait
for the app's own recorded budget. Closing a console window is a fallback, not
the supported stop.

### Running as a Windows service

Two commands, from an **elevated (Administrator)** shell:

```powershell
autumn serve install-service     # build, register, start
autumn serve uninstall-service   # stop, deregister, clean up
```

`install-service` builds the app, registers a service named
`autumn-<project>-<dirhash>`, sets it to start automatically at boot, arms a
restart-on-failure policy (5s, then 15s, then 60s, with the failure count
resetting after a quiet day), and starts it. The service appears in
`services.msc` and answers `sc.exe query`, `sc.exe stop` and `sc.exe start` like
any other.

It is not a separate lifecycle. The service hosts the same app child
`--daemon` hosts and writes the same pidfile, address file and log, so
`autumn serve status` and `autumn serve stop` keep working against it, and a
`sc.exe stop` runs the same cooperative drain. `autumn serve restart` restarts
the *service* through the Service Control Manager rather than starting a loose
daemon beside it, so the app that comes back is still supervised. An app that exits cleanly, or one
an operator stopped, is left stopped; an app that crashes or fails to boot is
restarted by the Service Control Manager.

`uninstall-service` stops the service (draining it), deregisters it, reaps a
managed Postgres cluster it may have left running, and removes the daemon's
state files. **Your database is not deleted** — the managed-Postgres data
directory is kept, and the command prints its path.

The service runs as `Local System`, the default account, which is what keeps
registration to one command with no credentials to store. It reads and writes
the state directory the installing user created, which is why that directory's
ACL admits `SYSTEM`. Non-default service accounts are not configured by these
commands; use `sc.exe config` if you need one.

## Databases

### DB-optional by default

A model-free app boots with no `DATABASE_URL` and no Postgres present. The
`autumn new --daemon` starter goes further: it builds with **no database at
all** (drops the `db` feature and the migration wiring), so the binary links no
Postgres client. This is the recommended shape for a local-first tool that
doesn't need persistence.

### Managed local Postgres (opt-in)

For apps that use `#[model]` / `#[repository]`, `autumn new --bundled-pg`
scaffolds a daemon that provisions and supervises a **local Postgres** in the
app's data dir. It is behind the non-default `managed-pg` feature; the
scaffold writes `managed-pg-bundled` (which implies it, plus a vendored
Postgres) into the generated `Cargo.toml` for you. Wiring the provider into an
existing app means adding it yourself:

```toml
autumn-web = { version = "0.8", features = ["managed-pg"] }
```

It wires a `ManagedPostgresPoolProvider` through the existing
[pluggable pool provider](./custom-subsystems.md) — there are no changes to the
query path — and ties the cluster's lifecycle to the daemon via an
`on_shutdown` hook:

```rust
let pg = autumn_web::managed_pg::ManagedPostgresPoolProvider::new();
let pg_shutdown = pg.clone();
autumn_web::app()
    .with_pool_provider(pg)
    .on_shutdown(move || {
        let pg = pg_shutdown.clone();
        async move { pg.stop().await; }
    })
    // ... routes, migrations ...
    .run()
    .await;
```

First-run provisioning (`initdb`) is idempotent and bounded; a cluster that
fails to start surfaces a clear diagnostic instead of hanging.

Two build modes select where the Postgres binaries come from:

- **`managed-pg`** — binaries are **downloaded on first run** (network
  required once), then cached in the data dir.
- **`managed-pg-bundled`** — binaries are **embedded in the app executable** at
  build time, so the end user installs nothing.

#### Bundled-binary caveats

- **Per target.** The embedded binaries match the build target; there is no
  trivial cross-compile.
- **Size.** The executable grows by tens of MB up to ~150MB.
- **Still a child process.** "Bundled" means the binaries ride along in the
  executable and are extracted on first run; Postgres still runs as a
  supervised `postgres` child with an on-disk data dir — it is **not** linked
  in-process like SQLite.

## Database backups

`autumn db backup` and `autumn db restore` capture the databases your app
actually uses — on Postgres as logical dumps, on SQLite as a file
snapshot. They resolve the connection URL(s) through the **same**
path as `autumn migrate` and the other `autumn db` commands — control plus every
configured shard, under the active profile/`.env` overlay — so a backup captures
exactly what the running app reads. On a managed-Postgres daemon the bundled
`pg_dump`/`pg_restore` are used automatically, so there are no external client
tools to install.

On the [SQLite tier](./sqlite-in-production.md) neither tool is involved at all:
a `sqlite://` target is captured with SQLite's own `VACUUM INTO` (one
transactional statement, safe against a live app) and the artifact is a
`control.sqlite` database file. Everything below — the run directory, `--keep`,
`--upload`, `restore` — works the same; only `--format`, which grades Postgres
artifacts, does not apply.

```sh
# Back up control + every shard into ./backups/<profile>/<timestamp>/
autumn db backup

# Compressed by default (pg_dump custom format). Plain SQL instead:
autumn db backup --format plain

# Only the control database, or a single shard:
autumn db backup --control-only
autumn db backup --shard us_east

# Keep only the newest 7 runs, pruning older ones after a successful backup:
autumn db backup --keep 7 --dir /var/backups/myapp
```

Each run writes a self-describing directory containing a `manifest.json` plus
one artifact per database. Every artifact's integrity is verified (custom dumps
via `pg_restore --list`, plain dumps via `pg_dump`'s completion marker) **before**
the run is reported successful; a partial or failed run is removed and never
counted toward `--keep` retention.

If `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` are not on `PATH` (and you are not on a managed-Postgres
app that bundles them), install the PostgreSQL client tools or point
`AUTUMN_PG_BIN_DIR` at their `bin` directory. `autumn doctor` warns when they are
missing.

### Scheduling

**cron** — a nightly backup with 7-day retention:

```cron
# m h dom mon dow  command
0 2 * * *  cd /srv/myapp && AUTUMN_ENV=prod autumn db backup --keep 7 --dir /var/backups/myapp
```

**systemd timer** — the same schedule as a service + timer pair:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp-backup.service
[Unit]
Description=Nightly Autumn database backup

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=/srv/myapp
Environment=AUTUMN_ENV=prod
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/autumn db backup --keep 7 --dir /var/backups/myapp
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp-backup.timer
[Unit]
Description=Run the Autumn database backup nightly

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```sh
systemctl enable --now myapp-backup.timer   # arm it
systemctl list-timers myapp-backup.timer     # confirm the next run
```

### Restore drill

Rehearse recovery before you need it. `restore` is gated by the **same
production guard** as `autumn db drop`: against a `prod` (or other non-`dev`/`test`)
profile it refuses unless you pass `--force`, and it verifies every artifact's
integrity before touching any database.

```sh
# Restore the whole run (control + shards) — safe on a dev/test profile:
autumn db restore ./backups/dev/20260710T020000Z

# Restore just one shard from a run:
autumn db restore ./backups/dev/20260710T020000Z --shard us_east

# Against production you must opt in explicitly (this overwrites data):
AUTUMN_ENV=prod autumn db restore /var/backups/myapp/prod/20260710T020000Z --force
```

A good drill: restore the latest backup into a scratch database, run
`autumn doctor` / your smoke tests against it, then discard it. Confirming a
backup restores cleanly is the only way to know it is real.

### Offsite backups

A backup on the same disk as the database is not disaster recovery: one failed
drive takes the app and every backup with it. Point `autumn db backup` at an
**S3-compatible** offsite destination (AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze
B2, Garage) and it uploads each completed run **after** local integrity
verification passes, then **verifies every remote object matches the local
file** before reporting success. If the local backup succeeds but the upload
fails, the command says so unambiguously and exits non-zero — the local artifact
is left intact.

Configure the destination in `autumn.toml` under `[backup.offsite]`. Credentials
are supplied by **env-var indirection**: config names the environment variables
the access key / secret are read from; the secret values never live in config,
argv, logs, or error messages.

```toml
[backup.offsite]
# Upload after every `autumn db backup`, without needing --upload:
auto_upload = true
# Key prefix inside the bucket (optional; objects are keyed
# {prefix}/{profile}/{timestamp}/{file}):
prefix = "db"
# Independent remote retention: keep the newest N uploaded runs per profile,
# pruning older ones only after a verified upload (never the just-uploaded run):
keep = 30

[backup.offsite.s3]
bucket   = "myapp-db-offsite"
region   = "auto"                       # R2 uses "auto"; MinIO ignores it
endpoint = "https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
force_path_style = true                 # required by MinIO / R2 / most self-hosted
# Credentials by env-var indirection — names, not values:
access_key_id_env     = "AUTUMN_OFFSITE_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
secret_access_key_env = "AUTUMN_OFFSITE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
```

Every setting also has an `AUTUMN_BACKUP__OFFSITE__*` environment override (e.g.
`AUTUMN_BACKUP__OFFSITE__S3__BUCKET`) and honors profile overlays
(`[profile.prod.backup.offsite]`), matching the rest of Autumn's config.

By default the offsite destination must be **distinct** from the app's
user-facing `[storage.s3]` bucket. Pointing both at the same bucket+endpoint
requires the explicit opt-in `allow_shared_bucket = true`.

```sh
# Export the credentials the config names, then upload with the backup:
export AUTUMN_OFFSITE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...          # never committed
export AUTUMN_OFFSITE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
autumn db backup --upload --keep 7 --dir /var/backups/myapp

# List what's offsite (timestamp, size, files) for the active profile:
autumn db offsite list
```

`autumn doctor` includes an `offsite_backup` check that flags an unset bucket, a
shared bucket without opt-in, or credentials that are not ready — without ever
printing a credential value.

**Scheduling.** Extend the cron / systemd recipe above with `--upload` (or set
`auto_upload = true` and drop the flag):

```cron
0 2 * * *  cd /srv/myapp && AUTUMN_ENV=prod autumn db backup --upload --keep 7 --dir /var/backups/myapp
```

```ini
# In the systemd unit's [Service] section, load the offsite credentials from a
# root-only env file and add --upload to the backup command:
EnvironmentFile=/etc/myapp/offsite.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/autumn db backup --upload --keep 7 --dir /var/backups/myapp
```

**Restore-from-offsite drill.** List the offsite runs, then restore one directly
— it downloads the run to a temp directory and applies the **same** integrity
verification and production `--force` guard as a local restore:

```sh
# See what's available offsite:
autumn db offsite list

# Restore the newest offsite run for a profile (into a scratch/dev DB):
autumn db restore offsite:dev/latest

# Or an explicit run, into production (this overwrites data):
AUTUMN_ENV=prod autumn db restore offsite:prod/20260710T020000Z --force
```

**Encryption posture.** Transfers use **TLS in transit** (HTTPS to the S3
endpoint). At rest, objects are protected by the **provider's server-side
encryption** (enable SSE / bucket default encryption on your bucket). Uploads
send `x-amz-checksum-sha256` so the endpoint validates payload integrity
server-side. **Client-side backup encryption** (encrypting the artifact with a
framework-managed key before it leaves the host) is a named follow-up — see the
`autumn/src/encryption.rs` AES-256-GCM envelope — and is **not** applied by this
slice.

## Out of scope

SQLite as an app backend, in-process Postgres, and *Unix* system-service
installation (systemd unit / launchd plist) are intentionally not part of daemon
mode — see issue #1119 for rationale. Windows Service registration **is** part
of it (see [Windows](#windows)): WSL2 was the previous answer there and it is
not an operator's answer, since it is unavailable on many Windows Server
installs and offers no boot start or crash supervision.
