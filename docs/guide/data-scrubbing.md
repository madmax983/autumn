# Data Scrubbing — Refreshing Staging From Production

The most common reason a team copies a production database is to reproduce a bug
or rehearse a migration. With [`autumn db backup`](daemon.md#database-backups)
that copy is one command away — PII and all — onto laptops and shared staging
boxes.

`autumn db scrub` closes that gap. It rewrites every PII-classified column with
deterministic, constraint-valid fake values, so the copy still behaves like the
real database (same row counts, same foreign keys, same uniqueness) while
carrying none of the real values.

The classification is **fail-closed and schema-driven**: the column universe
comes from introspecting the live database, not from a config file, so a column
added yesterday cannot be missing from it. A column that is neither
PII-classified nor explicitly declared safe aborts the scrub.

> **Postgres only.** Scrubbing targets the same databases `autumn migrate`
> resolves — the control database plus every configured shard.

## The drill: production → staging in one pass

```sh
# 1. On the production host: take a backup.
AUTUMN_ENV=prod autumn db backup --keep 7

# 2. Move the run directory to the staging host (scp, rsync, or
#    `autumn db backup --upload` + `autumn db restore offsite:prod/latest`).

# 3. On the staging host: restore it and scrub it in one command.
AUTUMN_ENV=staging autumn db scrub \
    --artifact backups/prod/20260101T020000Z --force
```

Step 3 restores the artifact into the database the `staging` profile resolves,
then anonymizes it. `--force` is required because `staging` is not `dev`/`test`
— the same production guard as `autumn db drop`.

To hand a teammate an artifact that is *already* scrubbed, add `--output`:

```sh
AUTUMN_ENV=staging autumn db scrub \
    --artifact backups/prod/20260101T020000Z \
    --output backups/scrubbed --force
```

That writes a fresh, self-describing backup run under `backups/scrubbed/` taken
from the scrubbed database — safe to copy onto a laptop.

You can also scrub a database in place, with no artifact involved:

```sh
autumn db scrub                 # scrub the resolved dev database
autumn db scrub --check         # classify only; write nothing (CI)
autumn db scrub --dry-run       # print the exact SQL; write nothing
```

---

## The classification workflow

Autumn classifies columns from three sources, in precedence order.

### 1. What the framework already knows

Two sources need **no declaration at all**:

- **`#[encrypted]` model columns.** An at-rest-encrypted column is PII by
  construction, so it is always scrubbed — and it is **re-encrypted**, not
  overwritten with a plain string: the replacement is a valid AEAD envelope
  produced row by row under the target database's own key, in the same
  (deterministic or randomized) mode the model declared. Writing plaintext there
  would make every later repository read of that row fail as malformed
  ciphertext, so a `safe` declaration may not override the classification and a
  plaintext strategy is refused outright. `null` is accepted on a nullable
  encrypted column. The scrub needs the target's `active_record_encryption`
  credentials for this and refuses before writing anything if they are missing.
  It also refuses if it cannot tell *which* columns are encrypted — a host with
  the CLI and `scrub.toml` but no `src/models` must name them, with their mode,
  under `[tables.<t>.encrypted]`:

  ```toml
  [tables.users.encrypted]
  api_token = "randomized"
  email = "deterministic"   # the mode matters: re-encrypting a deterministic
                            # column in randomized mode leaves ciphertext the
                            # app can no longer equality-query
  ```
- **Tables registered with the GDPR anonymize strategy** — a
  `GdprRegistry::register(ModelRegistration::anonymize("comments"))` call in your
  app classifies every non-key column of `comments` as PII. Because that is a
  table-level signal, a `safe` declaration **may** narrow it. The scanner reads
  the registration statically, so it needs a string-literal table name; a
  computed one is reported rather than silently ignored.

Primary- and foreign-key columns are never claimed by the table-level
inference: rewriting a key would break referential integrity. Neither are
generated columns, which Postgres refuses to `UPDATE` and which a scrub of their
source columns already covers.

`[defaults] safe_columns` is a cross-table convenience, not a per-column review,
so it does **not** narrow a GDPR anonymize registration — only an explicit
`[tables.<t>] safe` entry does.

### 2. What you declare

Everything else lives in `scrub.toml` at the project root (override with
`--config`):

```toml
# scrub.toml

# Columns that are safe in EVERY table — the one-line escape from repeating
# `id` / `created_at` / `updated_at` in every stanza.
[defaults]
safe_columns = ["id", "created_at", "updated_at"]

[tables.users]
# Reviewed and deliberately kept verbatim.
safe = ["role", "locale", "is_active"]

[tables.users.pii]
email = "email"
full_name = "name"
phone = "phone"
bio = "redact"
last_login_ip = "redact"

[tables.invoices]
safe = ["amount_cents", "currency", "status"]

[tables.invoices.pii]
billing_address = "redact"
```

### 3. Adopting it on an existing schema

You do not have to write that file by hand. Run:

```sh
autumn db scrub --check
```

On a schema with undeclared columns it exits non-zero, lists them, and prints a
paste-ready stanza:

```text
✗ 4 column(s) are neither PII-classified nor declared safe, so the scrub cannot
  prove they carry no real data:
    - users.bio
    - users.email
    - users.full_name
    - users.role
  Declare each one in scrub.toml — under [tables.<table>.pii] to replace it, or
  in `safe` to keep it verbatim. Run `autumn db scrub --check` for a paste-ready
  starting point.

# Paste into scrub.toml, then replace `auto` with an explicit strategy
# (email/name/phone/redact/null/uuid/bytes/json/zero/epoch), or move the
# column into that table's `safe = [...]` list if it holds no PII.

[tables.users.pii]
bio = "auto"
email = "auto"
full_name = "auto"
role = "auto"
```

Paste it, move the genuinely-safe columns into `safe = [...]`, and re-run.

### Keep it honest in CI

```yaml
- name: PII classification is complete
  run: |
    autumn db create
    autumn migrate
    autumn db scrub --check
```

`--check` reads the schema from a live database — the same one `autumn migrate`
resolves — so run it after the migration step your CI already has. It writes
nothing and exits non-zero when any column is unclassified, so a pull request
that adds a column without declaring it fails before it merges.
That is the property no third-party scrubber can offer: the classification is
checked against the real schema, not against yesterday's config file.

### 4. Framework-owned tables

Introspection deliberately skips `autumn_*` / `_autumn*` tables — exactly as
`autumn db pull` and `autumn schema pull` do — so their columns are not part of
the classified universe. Some of them nonetheless carry **app-supplied**
payloads: a queued job's arguments, an offline-sync row buffer, an experiment
assignment.

A scrub therefore *warns* about the ones it finds and tells you which they are.
`api_tokens` is on that list too — production API tokens inherited by a staging
copy are a live credential leak, not merely a PII one.

To have them emptied as part of the scrub, opt in:

```toml
[framework]
purge = ["api_tokens", "autumn_jobs", "autumn_job_tracking", "autumn_sync_pending", "autumn_sync_rows"]
```

Those `DELETE`s run inside the same transaction as the column rewrites. `purge`
only accepts framework-owned names (`autumn_*` / `_autumn*`, plus the
framework's unprefixed tables such as `api_tokens`) — a user table
listed there is an error, because emptying one outright is never something a
scrub should do behind a one-word config key. Schema bookkeeping
(`autumn_migration_checksums`, `_autumn_shard_map`) is never offered.

---

## Sampling: a laptop-sized subset

A scrubbed copy of a 400 GB production database is still 400 GB. `--sample`
emits a **referentially-intact subset** in the same pass, so what you carry away
is small *and* anonymized:

```sh
# 1% of users, plus everything those users relate to, scrubbed.
autumn db scrub --sample users=1%

# An absolute count instead, and two roots in one run.
autumn db scrub --sample users=500 --sample orders=2000
```

The amount applies **per target**: with shards configured, `--sample orders=500`
selects up to 500 rows from each database, not 500 across the topology.

Sampling is a phase of the scrub, never a command of its own: the subset and the
rewrites commit in one transaction, so there is no flag combination that emits
sampled-but-unscrubbed rows.

### How rows are chosen

You name the **roots**. Everything else follows the foreign key graph the
database itself reports:

- **Descend** — rows that reference a selected row are selected too, and they
  carry their own children in turn. That is what "1% of users plus all their
  data" means.
- **Ascend** — rows a selected row references are selected, so every foreign key
  resolves. Those rows are *not* descended from, which is what stops one shared
  parent (an org, a plan) from dragging its whole subtree back in. The other
  children of that org are therefore unreachable, and the run says so rather
  than emptying them.

### Per-table rules

Two rules live alongside the PII declaration, in the same `scrub.toml`:

```toml
[sample]
# Reference data: copied whole, and never descended from.
always_include = ["countries", "currencies", "plans"]
# Excluded entirely — the subset is not the place for an audit trail.
never_include = ["audit_logs", "request_logs"]
```

### Deterministic

Row selection is ordered by a hash of `--seed` and the row's primary key — not
by physical order, and not by `random()`. The same seed against the same source
data selects the identical rows, so a teammate can rebuild the exact subset that
exhibits a bug:

```sh
autumn db scrub --sample users=1% --seed 20260101
```

The seed defaults to `0`, so a run is reproducible whether or not you pass one.

That guarantee holds across operators, not just across repeats on one machine.
The key is hashed from its text rendering, and several session settings change
what that rendering is — `DateStyle` for a `date` or `timestamp` key,
`bytea_output`, `extra_float_digits`, `IntervalStyle`, `TimeZone`,
`lc_monetary` for a `money` key — so the scrub pins all of them for its own
transaction. Without that, the same seed over the
same `date` primary key selects a different subset under `DateStyle = ISO, YMD`
than under `Postgres, DMY`, and neither operator has any way to tell.

### Fail-closed, same as the classification

Sampling refuses before it deletes anything when it cannot prove the result:

- a table **no root can reach** through the graph (it would be emptied without
  saying so) — name it as a root, or declare it `always_include` /
  `never_include`. Being connected to a root is not enough: the walk descends
  only out of a root and out of the tables it descended into, so a table hanging
  off one it merely *ascended* into (that shared org), or off an
  `always_include` lookup table, is not reachable;
- a foreign key pointing **into** a `never_include` table, which would dangle;
- a table with **no primary key**, which has no row identity to select on;
- a **reference cycle** between tables the sample removes rows from, where those
  removals have no order that keeps every constraint satisfied (copying one of
  them whole with `always_include` takes it out of the removals and breaks the
  cycle);
- a **framework-owned table referencing a sampled one** — those rows are outside
  the sample, so empty them in the same run with `[framework] purge`;
- a **retained table referencing a purged one** — the mirror image. A purge of a
  framework table normally runs before the sample, so that the case above holds;
  when a table the sample *empties* references it, the purge waits until after
  the sample instead. But when a table whose rows the sample *keeps* references
  it, no order works and the run refuses: stop purging that table, or drop the
  referencing one with `never_include`;
- a **purge needed both before and after the sample**: one framework table that
  references a subsetted table (so its purge must run first) *and* is referenced
  by a table the sample empties (so its purge must run last). The only valid
  order interleaves the sample's own deletes around the purge, which one atomic
  sample between two purge passes cannot express;
- **legacy `INHERITS` table inheritance** anywhere in `public`. A declarative
  partition the sample models through its parent on purpose; an inheritance
  child is an ordinary table it would plan separately, while `DELETE FROM
  parent` reaches the child's rows anyway — the statements are not written `ONLY
  parent` — so the two would delete each other's selections. A scrub *without*
  `--sample` is unaffected and still runs;
- a **foreign key declared on a partition** rather than on its partitioned
  parent. The sample plays a partition's rows through that parent, whose rows
  span every partition, so it cannot honour a key binding one partition alone.
  Declare the key on the partitioned parent — Postgres then clones it to each
  partition, and the clone is followed through the parent as usual.

A root asked for exactly `100%` keeps every row, so it counts as removing none:
a framework table referencing it is not refused, and it carries no delete-order
constraint. It still descends, which is the point — `users=100%` keeps every user
and subsets what hangs off them.

`autumn db scrub --check --sample users=1%` proves the plan is complete and
writes nothing — run it in CI next to the classification check. The foreign key
re-count below is an apply-time check, so `--check` does not run it.

### What it reports

Every run prints per-table row counts, the total against the source, and the
size after the subsetted tables are compacted:

```text
  ℹ Sampling control from users 1%, seed 0 — the same seed against the same source selects the identical rows.
  ── control: sampled rows ──
    users: 1000000 → 10000 row(s) (1.0%, root)
    comments: 4820113 → 48221 row(s) (1.0%, related)
    countries: 249 → 249 row(s) (100.0%, always-include)
    audit_logs: 91002881 → 0 row(s) (0.0%, never-include)
    Total: 96823243 → 58470 row(s) (0.1% of the source), settled in 3 pass(es).
  ✓ 14 foreign key(s) re-verified — every reference in the subset resolves.
    Table size: 402.1 GB → 1.4 GB (0.3% of the source).
```

`[framework] purge` and `[sample] never_include` both empty their tables **again
after the column rewrites**, and that final pass is the one the guarantee rests
on. Earlier passes exist only to
make the sample's deletes possible; a trigger on a scrubbed table — an audit or
history trigger copying `OLD` values — can write fresh rows carrying the original
PII into either kind of table while the rewrites run, long after those. Both
settings promise the same thing — this table ends up empty — so both are enforced
last. (The scrub
still warns when a table it writes to carries user-defined triggers: emptying the
destination cannot help a trigger that writes somewhere the purge list does not
name.)

Running that pass last has a cost, and it is a **refusal** rather than a
warning. Its own `DELETE`s fire after every column rewrite, so an archive
trigger on a purged or `never_include` table can copy the rows it is removing
into an ordinary classified table that has already been scrubbed — putting real
values into a table the run reports as clean, and into any `--output` artifact.
No ordering avoids it (the trigger graph decides, and can be cyclic) and no
postcondition catches it (a trigger body can write anywhere), so a `DELETE`
trigger — or an `ON DELETE` rewrite rule, which reaches the same destinations
through `pg_rewrite` rather than `pg_trigger` — on a table the run empties is
refused before anything is written, by `--check` and `--dry-run` too. Drop or disable the trigger on the copy
(`ALTER TABLE audit_logs DISABLE TRIGGER audit_archive`) and the run proceeds —
a disabled trigger cannot fire, so it does not hold the refusal. The check
follows `pg_inherits` down, too: `DELETE FROM parent` fires a trigger declared
on a leaf partition, so a trigger anywhere below an emptied table refuses it.

After that pass, every promised-empty table is **counted**, and a run that finds
rows in one aborts. Ordering the removals cannot rule this out: each `DELETE`
fires triggers, and one of those can insert into a table an earlier `DELETE`
already emptied — an `ON DELETE` archive trigger between two promised-empty
tables does exactly that, and the trigger graph can be cyclic. So the promise is
checked rather than arranged, the same way the foreign keys are re-counted rather
than trusted to the walk.

The foreign key re-check runs **inside** the scrub's transaction, so a violation
rolls the whole run back rather than handing you a broken copy. It counts orphans
per constraint under that constraint's own NULL rule: a partly-NULL composite
reference satisfies the default `MATCH SIMPLE` and is skipped, but violates
`MATCH FULL` and is counted — which matters because the one thing this re-check
adds over Postgres itself is catching a constraint a migration left `NOT VALID`,
where the server never revisits the rows that predate it. Afterwards each
subsetted table is rewritten with `VACUUM (FULL, ANALYZE)` — deleting rows on its
own frees no disk, and the point of a sample is the disk. `[framework] purge`
tables are rewritten and measured with them: they sit outside the sample's own
universe, but the run empties them, and an emptied offline-sync buffer is often
the largest thing it removes — leaving it out would report a laptop-sized result
for a database still holding that buffer's whole file.

The materialized views the run refreshes are measured too, on both sides of the
ratio (a view left `WITH NO DATA` that nothing populated reads is neither
refreshed nor measured — it occupies no heap). A view is rebuilt from whatever survives the sample, so one over a table
`always_include` keeps whole does not shrink at all; measuring the sampled base
tables alone reported `488.0 kB → 232.0 kB` on a database whose refreshed view
still held 44 MB. They are measured but not compacted — `REFRESH` has already
rewritten each one's heap.

`--dry-run` prints that whole sequence as SQL you can actually run. Each
target's block is preceded by a `\connect` line, because the printed stream is
one file and the blocks are destructive: without it, pasting runs every target's
transaction against whichever database the session happens to be on. That line
carries the target's whole connection string with its password removed — and
where the password cannot be removed with certainty, which is any keyword-form
string (`host=... password=...`, where libpq allows whitespace around the `=`
and quoted values with escapes), the run **refuses** rather than print a
destructive block with no boundary above it. Configure such a target as a URI to
use `--dry-run` on it; scrubbing it without `--dry-run` is unaffected.

Compaction is printed after **every** target's transaction, never between two of
them, and with `ON_ERROR_STOP` turned off first — because that is what the
command itself does: it commits each target and then compacts in a second pass
where a failed `VACUUM` is a warning. Printed inside a target's block it was
neither, and a `VACUUM` on the first target that timed out against a concurrent
reader ended the script with that database scrubbed and the second still holding
its production rows.

The boundary is checked twice, in two different currencies. First by psql, from
its own `:HOST`, `:PORT` and `:DBNAME` — the conninfo psql resolved, which a
failed `\connect` leaves describing the previous connection. That check is what
makes a failed reconnect unable to continue: measured, one target's script pasted
into a session on another printed `Previous connection kept` and then `query
ignored` for every statement from `BEGIN;` onward. It matters that this is psql's
view and not the server's, because `inet_server_addr()` and `inet_server_port()`
report the endpoint the *server* accepted on, not the one you configured — behind
a forwarder, a session connected to `127.0.0.1:15433` reports `127.0.0.1:5433`,
so two servers reached through different forwards can report the same pair.

The connection string therefore has to state both host and port. A port left to
libpq is **refused** rather than printed: psql resolves one at paste time — from
`PGPORT`, or 5432 — and the same host-only URI reaches 5433 under `PGPORT=5433`
and 5432 without it, two different servers. Accepting any port for the host would
drop the discriminator on exactly the pair this proof exists to tell apart, and
embedding the port the run resolved is no better, since libpq can take it from a
service file this command does not read. State it, or scrub without `--dry-run`.

A failover list (`host=db1,db2`) is matched the way libpq resolves it — host and
port paired positionally, a single port covering every host — since psql reports
the one server it selected. The compaction pass reconnects too, and carries the same
proof for the same reason.

The printed transaction also asserts `session_replication_role = origin` — the
precondition the run refuses to plan without. `origin` fires `O`/`A` triggers and
`replica` fires `R`/`A`, and the trigger analysis only ever saw the first set; the
script inherits whatever the pasting session is in, so it checks rather than
assumes.

That boundary is then checked again inside the transaction. `\connect` does **not** close the
existing connection when the new one fails: psql prints `Previous connection
kept` and the session carries on, so the block below it would run against the
previous target. Removing the password from the printed conninfo is what makes
that failure likely rather than remote. So each block opens with
`\set ON_ERROR_STOP on` — which covers running the file with `psql -f`, where a
failed `\connect` already halts — and, as its first statement inside the
transaction, one that aborts unless the session is on the target the block names
— the database name together with the address and port the server itself
reports:

```text
ERROR:  this block is for app at 10.0.0.3/32:5432, but the session is on app at
        10.0.0.2/32:5432 — the \connect above did not take effect (psql keeps
        the previous connection when one fails)
```

The name alone is not an identity. A sharded fleet runs the same database name
on every shard — the topology in [Sharding](sharding.md) names all three `app` —
so a retained connection to shard 0 answers `current_database()` exactly as the
intended shard would. Measured on two clusters both holding `app`: with a
name-only guard, shard 1's block scrubbed shard 0 from 200 users to 100, 400
comments to 200 and 500 audit rows to 0, while the shard it named went
untouched. Both are compared with `IS DISTINCT FROM`, because the server reports
neither over a Unix socket and `NULL <> NULL` would let the check pass by
failing to be false.

### `--dry-run` needs a TCP target

The address and port are what identify an endpoint, and a Unix socket has
neither. So `--dry-run` **refuses** to print a script for a socket target at all,
before printing a single line:

```text
✗ `--dry-run` cannot print a runnable script for 1 target(s):
    - control
  These are reached over a Unix socket, where the server reports no address and
  no port — and nothing else it reports identifies the instance either. ...
```

Nothing else the server reports can stand in. The cluster's `system_identifier`
is generated at initdb and an ordinary `LOGIN` role can read it, but a
**physical copy** carries the identifier of the cluster it was cloned from:
measured against a `pg_basebackup` clone of a live cluster, both reached over
`/tmp`, the guard saw the same database name, the same identifier and
`<null>/<null>` on both sides. The server's configured `port` does answer over a
socket, but two clusters on different socket directories can share one — measured
on two clusters both on 5433, the clone's script pasted at its origin passed a
port-based guard, committed, and took the **origin** from 200 users to 25. And
`data_directory` is server-*local*: two containers each answering
`/var/lib/postgresql/data` match on it while being different databases. It is
also restricted to `pg_read_all_settings`, so an ordinary role reads NULL for it
and loses even that.

Three narrower guards were each defeated by the next topology. That is the shape
of a value that does not exist rather than one not yet found, so the refusal
covers every socket target rather than trying a fourth. Configure the target over
TCP to use `--dry-run` on it; scrubbing a socket target *without* `--dry-run` is
unaffected, because the command holds its own connection and never has to prove
which one it is.

The same reasoning refuses three TCP shapes that cannot name **one** endpoint
either. A conninfo with **no port** leaves psql to resolve one when the script is
pasted — measured, the same host-only URI reaches 5433 under `PGPORT=5433` and
5432 without it. One stating **`hostaddr`** picks the endpoint independently of
`host`: `host=not-a-real-host.example hostaddr=127.0.0.1` connects although that
name does not resolve, psql still reports `HOST=not-a-real-host.example`, and
there is no `:HOSTADDR` to pin instead — `\echo [:HOSTADDR]` prints the name
back unexpanded. And one naming **several endpoints** is chosen between per
connection: 20 connections with `load_balance_hosts=random` split 7/13 across two
members, so the run sizes the sample on one member and the pasted script runs on
another. Against a two-member URI whose first member held 200 rows and whose
second held none, ten dry runs printed `LIMIT 2` six times and `LIMIT 0` four
times — and `LIMIT 0` selects no root rows, so the delete pass empties the table
instead of sampling it. Each of the three still scrubs without `--dry-run`.

Every value is asked of the target connection while the run plans, never
parsed out of its URL: libpq defaults an omitted database name to the user name,
which defaults to the OS user, and the connection already knows the answer those
rules produce. The guard is emitted after the session pins and every call in it
is `pg_catalog`-qualified, so a `public.current_database()` sitting ahead of
`pg_catalog` in the pasting session's `search_path` cannot answer for the
catalog — measured, such a function returned the intended name while
`pg_catalog.current_database()` returned the truth.

An interactive paste ignores `ON_ERROR_STOP`, but it cannot ignore an aborted
transaction: every following statement is refused with `current transaction is
aborted`, and the closing `COMMIT` rolls back. That guard is printed and never
executed by `autumn db scrub` itself, which opens its own connection and cannot
be on the wrong database.

That protection ends at the `COMMIT`, though, and one part of a target's plan
runs past it: `VACUUM (FULL)` cannot run inside a transaction block, so the
compaction is emitted outside the envelope. The `COMMIT` turns the guard's abort
into a `ROLLBACK` and clears the aborted state, leaving the server nothing to
refuse with — measured, a clone's script pasted at its origin had all 64
destructive statements refused and then ran six `VACUUM (FULL, ANALYZE)`
statements on the origin, each taking an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock and rewriting
the table. So psql decides that part instead of the server:

```
\set autumn_scrubbed false
BEGIN;
... the guarded transaction ...
SELECT true AS autumn_scrubbed \gset      -- its last statement
COMMIT;
\set autumn_commit_error :ERROR
SET search_path = pg_catalog, public;
SELECT (:'autumn_scrubbed'::bool AND NOT :'autumn_commit_error'::bool
        AND NOT (...the same predicate the guard uses...)) AS autumn_on_target \gset
\if :autumn_on_target
SET lock_timeout = '30s';
VACUUM (FULL, ANALYZE) "public"."users";
\endif
```

Being on the right server is not the same as having scrubbed it, so the fence
asks both. A statement failing inside the transaction for a reason the guard
knows nothing about — a lock timeout, a constraint — aborts it, and the printed
`COMMIT` still clears that state; measured, an endpoint-only probe then ran all
six compaction statements against a target whose scrub had just rolled back.
psql's `:ERROR` does not close it either, because psql reports that `ROLLBACK`
as a *success*. The transaction's last statement therefore sets a variable an
aborted transaction cannot set, and `:ERROR` is captured immediately after
`COMMIT` — by a `\set`, which executes no query and so does not reset it.

The same flag spans the whole stream, because `autumn db scrub` itself stops at
the first target that fails and never touches the rest. Each target block is
wrapped in `\if :autumn_ok`, so a target that rolls back is not followed by the
next one connecting and scrubbing anyway — measured with two targets, that used
to leave a partially scrubbed topology behind a stream that ended without an
error.

Both failure modes are closed, measured on psql 16.13: a false value prints
`query ignored` for every statement in the block, and a `\gset` whose query
*errored* leaves the variable unset, which `\if` reports as `Boolean expected`
and still skips. The `search_path` is re-pinned first because the run's own pins
are `SET LOCAL` — they belonged to the transaction that just rolled back.

One statement the dry run cannot print truthfully is the rewrite of an
`#[encrypted]` column: the scrub encrypts a fabricated value per row under the
**target's** key, and expressing that as SQL would mean embedding that key in a
script meant to be pasted and shared. Where a plan contains one, `--dry-run`
reports the plan as usual and then refuses to print the script at all:

```
✗ `--dry-run` cannot print a runnable script: 1 column(s) are #[encrypted]:
    - control: users.api_token
```

Printing the rest and omitting that one line is not an option, and neither is
marking it. A script missing its encrypted rewrites samples and empties exactly
as advertised, then commits a copy whose other columns are scrubbed and whose
encrypted ones still hold the original production ciphertext. And nothing placed
in the stream stops a paste partway: a `RAISE EXCEPTION` aborts its own
transaction — which does refuse the statements below it — but the `COMMIT` the
script prints turns that into a `ROLLBACK` and clears the state, after which the
out-of-transaction `VACUUM (FULL)` statements and the *next* target's `\connect`
and `DELETE`s execute for real. A `\quit` is worse still: `psql` exits and the
shell that launched it reads the remainder of the paste.

So the boundary is the same one the keyword-form conninfo gets below — the plan
above is complete and accurate, and the executable stream is withheld. Run
without `--dry-run` to apply it for real.

The walk prints as the loop it is — a `DO` block that repeats the pass and stops on one
that selects nothing — rather than as a single pass with a comment saying to
repeat it. The difference is not cosmetic: within a pass the statements run in
list order, and that order comes from the catalog, so one pass reaches only as
deep as the order happens to favour and everything below it is deleted. Nothing
would catch that — dropping a descendant leaves every foreign key satisfied, so
the integrity assertions still pass and the script commits a copy quietly
missing rows. The compaction is the only thing printed outside the transaction,
because `VACUUM (FULL)` cannot run inside one.

With `--output`, the artifact is captured **before** the compaction, not after.
Every lock is released when the scrub commits, so the gap between committing and
dumping is a gap in which a concurrent write could land unscrubbed rows in the
artifact; compaction is `VACUUM (FULL)` over every subsetted table, which on a
large source would stretch that gap from moments to minutes. It contributes
nothing to the artifact either — `pg_dump` is logical, so a compacted table dumps
to the same bytes — so it runs afterwards, on the live copy, where the reclaimed
disk is the point.

That leaves the unavoidable gap between the commit and the dump's own snapshot.
It is another reason the target should be a restored copy rather than a database
still taking writes: a scrub cannot hold locks it has already released.

Pair it with `--output` to hand a teammate a small, scrubbed artifact:

```sh
AUTUMN_ENV=staging autumn db scrub \
    --artifact backups/prod/20260101T020000Z \
    --sample users=1% --output backups/laptop --force
```

## Replacement strategies

| Strategy | Produces | Unique-safe |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` | Derived from the column type (the default for automatically-classified columns) | depends |
| `email` | `scrubbed+<token>@example.invalid` — syntactically valid, permanently undeliverable | ✅ |
| `name` | `Scrubbed <token>` | ✅ |
| `phone` | `+1555<digits>` | ❌ |
| `redact` | `[scrubbed:<token>]` | ✅ |
| `null` | `NULL` (refused on a `NOT NULL` column) | ✅ |
| `uuid` | A deterministic replacement UUID | ✅ |
| `bytes` | Deterministic replacement bytes | ✅ |
| `json` | `{"scrubbed": true}` | ❌ |
| `zero` | `0` / `false` | ❌ |
| `epoch` | `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` | ❌ |
| `encrypted` | A valid ciphertext envelope (chosen automatically for `#[encrypted]` columns; not declarable) | ✅ |

`<token>` is a hash over the row's primary key, salted with the column name —
one `md5` normally, and two independently-salted ones concatenated for a column
that must stay unique, so a length-bounded `varchar(n)` still has room for
enough entropy.
That makes every replacement:

- **deterministic** — the same row scrubs to the same value on every run, so
  re-running a scrub is idempotent;
- **unique per row** — a `UNIQUE` column stays unique; and
- **distinct per column** — two PII columns of one row never collide.

A table with **no** primary key falls back to the physical `ctid`: still unique
within the statement (so constraints hold), but not stable between runs.

`auto` derives a strategy from the column's type: text columns whose name
contains `email` get an address, other text is redacted, `uuid`/`bytea`/`jsonb`
get type-matched fakes, numbers (including `smallint`, `numeric` and `money`)
become `0`, booleans `false`, and timestamps — plus `date`, `time` and `timetz` —
the epoch. It refuses to guess for a Postgres type outside that set rather than
emit a statement that will fail.

Every strategy is also checked against the column *before* anything is written:
a text-shaped strategy on an `integer` or an `inet`, a `uuid` on a `text`
column, or a `null` on a `NOT NULL` column is a plan-time refusal, never an
apply-time error.

## What the scrub guarantees

- **Nothing runs against production by accident.** Writing refuses outside the
  `dev`/`test` profile without `--force`, the same protocol as `autumn db drop`.
  As defence in depth, a scrub also refuses when the write target is the
  database that **any** non-dev/test profile's *config file* declares — every
  `autumn-<profile>.toml` in the project is checked, not just the one an
  artifact's manifest names, so a bare `.dump` with no manifest is not treated
  as permission to continue. That guard has its own waiver,
  `--allow-source-overwrite`, rather than riding on `--force`: the staging drill
  always passes `--force`, so a guard `--force` waived would be inert in exactly
  the workflow it exists for.
- **A refusal writes nothing.** Classification completes before a single row is
  touched. The one exception is `--artifact`: the restore has to run before the
  scrub can read the schema it created, so a refusal *after* a restore leaves
  unscrubbed data in the target. The command says so in the loudest possible
  terms, and `autumn db scrub --check` catches an incomplete declaration before
  any restore happens — run it in CI.
- **Constraints survive.** PII is refused outright on a primary key, on **either
  side** of any foreign key (including every component of a composite one — so a
  natural key another table references, like `users.email` ← `orders.user_email`,
  is protected too), and on a `CHECK`-constrained column, where no fabricated
  value can be proven to satisfy the predicate. `null` is refused on a `NOT NULL`
  column and on a `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` unique index; a constant replacement is
  refused on any column covered by a unique index — composite, partial, and the
  input columns of a unique *expression* index (`(lower(email))`), whose
  uniqueness a per-row token cannot preserve through an arbitrary expression,
  and the *predicate* columns of a partial unique index, where a rewrite changes
  which rows the index covers; and a `varchar(n)` bound narrows the generated token or refuses,
  rather than truncating into collisions.
- **Writes cannot be redirected.** Every statement is `public`-qualified and the
  transaction pins `search_path`, so a role- or database-level tenant
  `search_path` cannot send an `UPDATE` to a table nothing classified. The
  planned tables — and the ones `[framework] purge` empties — are locked for the
  duration, so a row inserted between the classification snapshot and the
  rewrite cannot slip through.
- **`NULL`s stay `NULL`.** A scrub anonymizes values; it never invents them.
- **It is atomic.** Every statement for one database runs in a single
  transaction, so a failure can never leave a half-scrubbed database behind —
  and with shards configured, *every* database is classified before *any* of
  them is written, so an undeclared column on one shard cannot leave the rest of
  the topology half anonymized.
- **Credentials never appear.** No message ever prints a resolved URL.

## Limits

- **Postgres only**, and the `public` schema only. A database with base tables
  in another non-system schema is **refused** rather than reported clean over a
  universe the classifier never looked at — and a schema holding only a
  *materialized view* counts, since it keeps its own copy of whatever it
  selected from `public`. The same applies to a table the
  connecting role cannot see: the scrub compares `pg_class` against what it
  could actually read — tables **and** columns, since privileges are granted per
  column too — and refuses on any difference, so a privilege gap can never look
  like a clean bill of health. Foreign tables count as part of that universe: one
  left pointing at production would otherwise be classified by nothing.
- **Row-level security is refused** on every table the run reads or writes: the
  ones it rewrites, the ones `[framework] purge` and `never_include` empty, the
  ones the sample reads to decide what to keep, and both endpoints of every
  foreign key the run re-counts. A role that does not bypass RLS sees only the
  rows its policies expose, and each phase then reports a success it cannot
  stand behind — a partial rewrite, a table reported emptied that is not, or a
  re-count that misses the orphan it exists to find. Connect as the table owner
  or a `BYPASSRLS` role.

  The re-count's endpoints matter more than they look: a framework-owned table
  the run never writes still gets checked, because a constraint a migration left
  `NOT VALID` is never revalidated by Postgres, and a policy hiding the orphan
  would turn that check into a false clean bill of health.
- **Triggers are warned about, not disabled.** An audit or history trigger can
  copy the pre-scrub row into another table as the rewrite runs. The scrub names
  the tables carrying user triggers; check or disable them on the copy.
- **Materialized views are refreshed** (in dependency order — traced through
  ordinary views, and through the function dependencies PostgreSQL records, since
  a materialized view that reads another through one must still be rebuilt after
  it — inside the scrub's own transaction) since they hold their own copy of
  whatever they selected — so a refresh the role is not allowed to run rolls the
  rewrites back rather than committing base tables a stale view contradicts.
  The function hop is followed however the view reaches it: a direct call, a
  cast, an aggregate, a user-defined operator, or a domain's `CHECK`
  constraint. A view read through a function whose body PostgreSQL does *not*
  track, such as a SQL function written as a string literal or one in
  `plpgsql`, is **refused**: nothing records what it reads, so the order cannot
  be derived. Rewrite the function with `BEGIN ATOMIC`, which is tracked. On
  PostgreSQL 13 and older no SQL body is tracked at all, so a view reached
  through any function is refused there. A view left `WITH NO DATA` is
  the one exception: it holds no rows to scrub, so it is skipped rather than
  populated, and the scrub does not spend the query time and disk it was left
  unpopulated to save. If a populated view reads it, it is refreshed after all —
  the dependent cannot be rebuilt otherwise — and emptied again once that
  dependent has been, so both end as the run found them. Every view that had no
  data gets that closing `REFRESH ... WITH NO DATA`, which also settles a race:
  the scrub locks base tables, not views, so another session can populate a
  skipped view from pre-scrub rows while the run is open.
- **A key column holding PII can only be declared `safe`.** A natural key
  (`patients(ssn PRIMARY KEY)`) cannot be anonymized in place without rewriting
  every row that references it, which this command does not do — so it is kept
  verbatim and listed in the report. Restructure the schema or scrub it by hand.
- **A sample is valid, not representative.** `--sample` guarantees the subset is
  referentially intact and PII-free; it does not preserve distributions, and it
  never fabricates rows to pad a small table (that is `autumn seed`'s job).
- **Values are fake, not statistically faithful.** Replacements only need to be
  constraint-valid; there is no synthetic-data modelling or differential
  privacy.
- **Framework-owned tables are not column-classified**, exactly as `autumn db
  pull` and `autumn schema pull` skip them. The scrub warns about the ones that
  carry app-supplied payloads and can empty them on request — see
  [Framework-owned tables](#4-framework-owned-tables).
- **The artifact itself is still unscrubbed.** `autumn db scrub --artifact`
  anonymizes the *database*, not the dump it restored from. Delete the source
  artifact from the staging host once the scrub succeeds, or hand teammates the
  `--output` artifact instead.
