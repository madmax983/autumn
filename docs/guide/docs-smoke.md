# Docs Smoke Procedure

This docs-smoke procedure certifies the public first-run path for the published
Autumn 0.8.x line. It must use Rust 1.88.0+ and the published `autumn-cli` and
`autumn-web` crates unless the release is explicitly in a pre-publish rehearsal.

Run it in a clean temporary directory, not inside the Autumn checkout:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo install autumn-cli --version 0.8.0

mkdir autumn-docs-smoke
cd autumn-docs-smoke
autumn new smoke-app
cd smoke-app
autumn setup
cargo run
```

In a second terminal, verify the first route and framework endpoints:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/hello/world
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

Passing output:

- `/` returns `Welcome to smoke-app!`.
- `/hello/world` returns `Hello, world!`.
- `/health` returns:

  ```json
  { "status": "ok", "version": "0.8.0" }
  ```

Do not add `[patch.crates-io]`, path dependencies, or `cargo install --path`
when certifying the published-user path. Those are contributor-mode shortcuts,
not first-run documentation proof.

## Scaffold Reconciliation

The [upgrading guide](upgrading.md) documents `autumn upgrade` end to end.
Certify its scaffold half in the same smoke directory, on the app just
generated:

```bash
autumn upgrade --check
```

Passing output: exit status `0`, and a report ending

```text
  Your framework-owned files are up to date with this release.
```

A freshly generated app is, by construction, current. Then prove the drift path
by aging the app: delete a framework-owned file and remove its line from
`.autumn/scaffold.toml`, so the project looks like one scaffolded before that
file existed.

```bash
rm rust-toolchain.toml
grep -v '^"rust-toolchain.toml"' .autumn/scaffold.toml > /tmp/m && mv /tmp/m .autumn/scaffold.toml

autumn upgrade --check ; echo "exit=$?"
autumn upgrade
autumn upgrade --apply
autumn upgrade --check ; echo "exit=$?"
```

Passing output:

- the first `--check` prints `add  rust-toolchain.toml` and `exit=3`;
- the bare `autumn upgrade` prints the same file under `Scaffold files`, prints
  `Nothing was written`, and leaves `rust-toolchain.toml` absent;
- `--apply` recreates `rust-toolchain.toml`;
- the second `--check` prints `up to date` and `exit=0`.

The trailing `Upgrade guide:` line of every report must be a URL that resolves.

## Pre-Publish Rehearsal

Before the `autumn-cli` or `autumn-web` release has reached crates.io, the same
commands may be rehearsed against the workspace only if the release notes record
why the smoke is temporary:

```text
docs-smoke: workspace-prepublish rehearsal because autumn-cli/autumn-web 0.8.0
were not yet available on crates.io.
```

That rehearsal does not certify the release. The published docs-smoke must be
rerun with `cargo install autumn-cli --version 0.8.0` and no workspace patches
before announcing the release.
