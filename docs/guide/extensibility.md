# Extensibility in Autumn

Autumn ships with sensible defaults for everything — config loading, the
database pool, the session store, the telemetry subscriber, error pages, the
request cache, route handlers, middleware. None of those defaults are written
in stone. The framework gives you three different mechanisms to swap them out,
each suited to a different scope of change. Knowing which tier a piece of
behaviour lives in is the fastest way to find the right hook.

This guide names the three tiers, shows which subsystems live where, and
points you at the per-tier how-tos.

---

## The three tiers at a glance

| Tier | Mechanism | Scope | Typical use case |
|------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **1** | `AppBuilder::with_<subsystem>(impl Trait)` | Boot-time, one-per-app | Replace a framework subsystem (config loader, DB pool, session store, telemetry, error pages) |
| **2** | `#[intercept(Layer::new(...))]` | Per-request, stackable | Add cross-cutting middleware (caching, custom auth, request shaping, tracing) |
| **3** | `Plugin::build(app)` | Distribution wrapper around tier 1 + 2 | Ship a reusable integration as a crate (e.g. `autumn-aws-secrets-plugin`) |

These compose: a tier-3 `Plugin` typically does its work by calling tier-1 or
tier-2 hooks inside `build()`. There is no fourth tier — if you find yourself
reaching for one, file an issue.

---

## Tier 1: boot-time subsystem replacement

Tier-1 hooks let you replace a framework subsystem with your own
trait-implementing struct. Each is a fluent `with_<subsystem>` method on
`AppBuilder`. They run exactly once during `AppBuilder::run()`, before the
HTTP server starts.

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

#[autumn_web::main]
async fn main() {
    autumn_web::app()
        .with_config_loader(MyJsonConfigLoader::new("config.json"))
        .with_telemetry_provider(DatadogTelemetryProvider)
        .with_session_store(MyEncryptedCookieStore)
        .routes(routes![/* ... */])
        .run()
        .await;
}
```

### Subsystems available at tier 1

| Subsystem | Trait | Builder method | Default |
|-----------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Config loading | [`ConfigLoader`](../../autumn/src/config.rs) | `with_config_loader` | `TomlEnvConfigLoader` (five-layer TOML + env) |
| Database pool | [`DatabasePoolProvider`](../../autumn/src/db.rs) | `with_pool_provider` | `DieselDeadpoolPoolProvider` (deadpool + diesel-async) |
| Telemetry | [`TelemetryProvider`](../../autumn/src/telemetry.rs) | `with_telemetry_provider` | `TracingOtlpTelemetryProvider` (`tracing-subscriber` + optional OTLP) |
| Session store | [`SessionStore`](../../autumn/src/session.rs) | `with_session_store` | `MemoryStore` or `RedisStore` based on `session.backend` config |
| Error pages | [`ErrorPageRenderer`](../../autumn/src/error_pages/renderer.rs) | `error_pages` | Built-in HTML renderer |

See **[`custom-subsystems.md`](custom-subsystems.md)** for a per-subsystem
how-to with full code examples.

### When tier 1 is the right answer

- You want **one** subsystem behaving differently for the **whole app**.
- The replacement happens at **boot time**, not per-request.
- You want **type-checked** integration with the rest of the framework.

---

## Tier 2: per-request middleware via `#[intercept]`

Tier-2 hooks attach a tower-style `Layer` to a route or group of routes. They
run once per matching request and can stack arbitrarily.

```rust,no_run
# use autumn_web::prelude::*;
# struct CacheResponseLayer;
# impl CacheResponseLayer { fn new(_: ()) -> Self { Self } }
# let cache = ();

#[get("/expensive")]
#[intercept(CacheResponseLayer::new(cache.clone()))]
async fn expensive() -> &'static str {
    "computed once, served many"
}
```

### When tier 2 is the right answer

- You're augmenting **request handling**, not boot-time behaviour.
- You want the change to apply to **a subset** of routes (or all of them, but
  via stacking rather than replacement).
- Multiple instances should be **layered**, not "last one wins".

### Tier-2 examples

- **Caching** — `#[intercept(CacheResponseLayer::new(my_cache))]` is the
  intentional path for response caching. The `Cache` trait isn't a tier-1
  install because there is no single "framework cache" — different routes
  benefit from different cache configurations.
- **Custom tracing** — wrap a route with `#[intercept(TracingLayer)]` to
  emit additional spans without touching the global subscriber.
- **Auth shape variants** — apply `#[intercept(BearerAuthLayer)]` to API
  routes while leaving session-cookie routes untouched.

---

## Tier 3: distribution as a `Plugin`

Tier-3 packages tier-1 and tier-2 calls into a reusable struct that anyone can
install with a single line. This is the right shape for cross-organisation
distribution — publish a crate with a `Plugin` in it, users `cargo add` it and
write `.plugin(YourPlugin::new(...))`.

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::app::AppBuilder;
use autumn_web::plugin::Plugin;

pub struct AwsSecretsConfigPlugin {
    region: String,
}

impl Plugin for AwsSecretsConfigPlugin {
    fn build(self, app: AppBuilder) -> AppBuilder {
        // Tier-1 install inside the plugin's build() — the user just sees
        // `.plugin(AwsSecretsConfigPlugin::new("us-east-1"))`.
        app.with_config_loader(AwsSecretsConfigLoader::new(self.region))
    }
}

# pub struct AwsSecretsConfigLoader;
# impl AwsSecretsConfigLoader { fn new(_: String) -> Self { Self } }
# impl autumn_web::config::ConfigLoader for AwsSecretsConfigLoader {
#     async fn load(&self) -> Result<autumn_web::config::AutumnConfig, autumn_web::config::ConfigError> { unimplemented!() }
# }
```

End user:

```rust,no_run
# use autumn_web::prelude::*;
# struct AwsSecretsConfigPlugin;
# impl AwsSecretsConfigPlugin { fn new(_: &str) -> Self { Self } }
# impl autumn_web::plugin::Plugin for AwsSecretsConfigPlugin {
#     fn build(self, app: autumn_web::app::AppBuilder) -> autumn_web::app::AppBuilder { app }
# }
#[autumn_web::main]
async fn main() {
    autumn_web::app()
        .plugin(AwsSecretsConfigPlugin::new("us-east-1"))
        .run()
        .await;
}
```

### When tier 3 is the right answer

- You're packaging behaviour for **someone else** to consume.
- The behaviour spans **multiple tier-1 or tier-2 installs** and should
  travel together as a unit (e.g. an OTel plugin that installs both a
  `TelemetryProvider` AND a per-request tracing layer).
- You want **conflict detection** — two plugins claiming the same `name()`
  trigger a warning, so duplicate `.plugin(...)` calls don't silently shadow
  each other.

See [`autumn/src/plugin.rs`](../../autumn/src/plugin.rs) for the trait
definition and naming conventions for first-party vs third-party plugin
crates.

## Choosing between tiers — a quick decision tree

1. **"I want to change framework behaviour for the whole app, once at boot."**
   → Tier 1.
2. **"I want to apply a wrapper to specific requests."**
   → Tier 2.
3. **"I'm building this for someone else to install with one line."**
   → Tier 3, wrapping tier-1 or tier-2 calls.

If a subsystem you want to replace doesn't have a tier-1 method yet, file an
issue — adding one is mechanical and we generally welcome the patch.

## Forwarded headers in plugins

Plugin middleware that reads `X-Forwarded-*` headers directly is one PR away
from being CVE-shaped. Autumn centralises all forwarding-header trust logic in
a single `[security.trusted_proxies]` policy that every built-in middleware
honours.

> **Rule: never read `X-Forwarded-*` directly. Use `ClientAddr`, `ClientHost`,
> or `ClientScheme` from `autumn_web::extract`.**

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::extract::ClientAddr;
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

// Good: uses resolver-validated IP
#[get("/rate-check")]
async fn rate_check(ClientAddr(ip): ClientAddr) -> String {
    format!("your ip: {ip}")
}

// Bad: trusts attacker-controlled header
// let ip = req.headers().get("x-forwarded-for").unwrap(); // ← DO NOT DO THIS
```
