# Autumn Guide Index

Every guide page, grouped by what you came here to do. Each line says which
question the page answers — open the one that matches yours.

This page is an index only: it carries no answers of its own, so it can never
disagree with the page it points at. `scripts/check-docs-guide-index.sh` fails
the build when a guide page is missing from it, listed twice, or points
nowhere.
