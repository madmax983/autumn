# Background Jobs (`#[job]`)

Autumn provides first-class ad-hoc background jobs for request-triggered async work.

## Define a job

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct WelcomeEmailArgs {
    pub user_id: i64,
}

#[job(name = "send_welcome_email", max_attempts = 6, backoff_ms = 500)]
async fn send_welcome_email(state: AppState, args: WelcomeEmailArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> {
    // perform async side effect
    Ok(())
}
```

## Register jobs

```rust,ignore
autumn_web::app()
    .routes(routes![signup])
    .jobs(jobs![send_welcome_email])
    .run()
    .await;
```

## Enqueue from handlers

```rust,ignore
SendWelcomeEmailJob::enqueue(WelcomeEmailArgs { user_id: 42 }).await?;
```

## Delayed and scheduled jobs

Sometimes you want a job to run **once, at a future time** — "email a signup
reminder in 24h", "expire this cart in 30 minutes", "publish at 9am", "retry
this external call in 5 minutes". Use `enqueue_in` (relative delay) or
`enqueue_at` (absolute instant) instead of `enqueue`:

```rust,ignore
use std::time::Duration;

// Run once, 24 hours from now.
SendReminderJob::enqueue_in(ReminderArgs { user_id: 42 }, Duration::from_secs(24 * 60 * 60)).await?;

// Run once, at an absolute UTC instant.
let when = chrono::Utc::now() + chrono::TimeDelta::hours(2);
PublishPostJob::enqueue_at(PublishArgs { post_id: 7 }, when).await?;
```

The same free functions exist on the `job` module
(`autumn_web::job::enqueue_in(name, payload, delay)` /
`enqueue_at(name, payload, when)`), mirroring `enqueue`.

A delayed job is recorded immediately but is **not delivered to a worker until
its due time passes**. Once due, it runs through the normal path — the same
`max_attempts` / `initial_backoff_ms` retry/backoff and dead-letter semantics
apply unchanged. An `enqueue_at` time in the past runs immediately.

### Transactional delayed enqueue

Delayed enqueue composes with the transactional variants, so a job is invisible
to workers until **both** the row commits **and** the due time passes:

```rust,ignore
use scoped_futures::ScopedFutureExt;

// Crash-safe on Postgres: the future run time is written inside your tx.
db.tx(move |conn| async move {
    let cart = carts::create(new_cart, conn).await?;
    autumn_web::job::enqueue_in_on_conn(
        "expire_cart",
        ExpireArgs { cart_id: cart.id },
        Duration::from_secs(30 * 60),
        conn,
    ).await?;
    Ok(cart)
}.scope_boxed()).await?;

// Process-local after-commit defer (not crash-safe), absolute or relative:
autumn_web::job::enqueue_in_after_commit("send_reminder", args, Duration::from_secs(3600)).await?;
autumn_web::job::enqueue_at_after_commit("publish_post", args, when).await?;
```

### Durability

| Backend    | Pending delay survives restart? | How                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `postgres` | **Yes** (crash-safe)            | future `run_at` column; claim query skips it until due |
| `redis`    | **Yes** (crash-safe)            | `:delayed` ZSET scored by due-time; promoted to the queue when due |
| `local`    | **No** (local-safe only)        | in-process timer; a pending delay is **lost on restart**, consistent with other in-process caveats |

### Pick the right tool

| Need                                            | Use                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Recurring** work on a cron / fixed interval   | `#[scheduled]`               |
| **One-shot** "run once, later" timer            | delayed `#[job]` (`enqueue_in` / `enqueue_at`) |
| **Durable multi-step** orchestration, long-horizon timers, history | Autumn Harvest |

`#[scheduled]` is for repeating tasks; it does not do one-shot future work.
Autumn Harvest is for durable workflows with history and stronger orchestration
semantics — heavier than a one-shot timer. Delayed `#[job]` fills the gap
between "now" and "durable workflow".

### Admin dashboard

Delayed jobs appear in a distinct **Scheduled** list on `GET /admin/jobs`
showing each job's due time, and can be **canceled before they run**. (A job
that has already become due / started running cannot be canceled.)

## Backend selection (`autumn.toml`)

```toml
[jobs]
backend = "local"   # local | postgres | redis
workers = 2
max_attempts = 5
initial_backoff_ms = 250

[jobs.postgres]
# Reuses the configured [database] pool. No extra URL needed.
visibility_timeout_ms = 30000   # default: 30 000 ms

[jobs.redis]
url = "redis://127.0.0.1/"
key_prefix = "autumn:jobs"
visibility_timeout_ms = 30000
```

| Backend | Durable | Multi-replica safe | Extra infra |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local` | No | No (in-process) | None |
| `postgres` | Yes | Yes (SKIP LOCKED) | DB only — no Redis |
| `redis` | Yes | Yes | Redis |

- `local`: in-process channel, zero configuration. Jobs are lost on restart. Fine
  for development or single-process demos.
- `postgres`: Postgres-backed queue that reuses your existing `[database]` pool.
  Jobs survive restarts and are claimed atomically across replicas via
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Requires the `db` feature and an
  `autumn migrate` run before the first worker starts.
- `redis`: Durable, Redis-backed queue for multi-replica workers. Higher
  throughput ceiling than `postgres` but adds Redis as an infrastructure dependency.

## Postgres delivery semantics

The Postgres backend provides **at-least-once delivery**. Each job is a row in
the `autumn_jobs` table. Workers claim a row atomically with
`UPDATE … WHERE id IN (SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)`, which prevents any
two replicas from claiming the same job simultaneously.

A claimed job's status is set to `running` with a `claimed_at` timestamp and a
`claimed_by` worker id. A maintenance loop running inside each worker process
requeues jobs whose `claimed_at` is older than `jobs.postgres.visibility_timeout_ms`.
Recovered stale claims consume another attempt and record a `last_error`
explaining the visibility timeout.

If a job exhausts `max_attempts`, its status is set to `failed`; it is no longer
retried.

Because the backend provides at-least-once delivery, handlers must be idempotent.
A slow worker that outlives the visibility timeout can overlap with a recovered
retry, so external side effects should use natural idempotency keys such as the
job id, a domain aggregate id, or a provider idempotency token.

## Redis delivery semantics

The Redis backend provides **at-least-once delivery**. A job is written as a
durable record, queued by id, atomically claimed into an in-flight set, and
acked only after the handler returns `Ok(())`.

If a worker crashes after claiming a job, the record remains in Redis. Another
worker requeues the stale claim after `jobs.redis.visibility_timeout_ms`.
Recovered stale claims consume another attempt and retain a `last_error`
explaining the visibility timeout. If the job has exhausted `max_attempts`, it
is moved to the dead-letter list instead of being requeued.

Because Redis uses at-least-once delivery, handlers must be idempotent. A worker
that is slow beyond the visibility timeout can overlap with a recovered retry,
so external side effects should use natural idempotency keys such as the job id,
domain aggregate id, or provider idempotency token.

## Retry/backoff and dead letters

- Jobs retry with exponential backoff (`initial_backoff_ms * 2^(attempt-1)`).
- Retries stop at `max_attempts` (job-level override or config default).
- Exhausted jobs are dead-lettered.
- Redis retries are scheduled in Redis before the worker moves on, so a crash
  during the backoff window does not drop the job.

## Job priorities

By default every job drains from a single FIFO queue, so a flood of low-value
work (analytics rollups, thumbnails, bulk re-indexing) can sit *ahead of*
latency-sensitive work like password-reset emails or payment-webhook fan-out.
Named queues fix this head-of-line blocking: route each job to a queue, and let
workers drain queues in priority order.

Tag a job's queue with `queue = "..."`. Jobs with no `queue` land on the
`"default"` queue, so apps that don't opt in behave exactly as before.

```rust,ignore
#[job(queue = "critical", max_attempts = 5)]
async fn send_password_reset(state: AppState, args: ResetArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> { … }

#[job(queue = "low")]
async fn rebuild_search_index(state: AppState, args: IndexArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> { … }

// No queue → the "default" queue.
#[job]
async fn send_receipt(state: AppState, args: ReceiptArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> { … }
```

Configure the worker drain order in `autumn.toml`. Two forms:

```toml
# Strict priority — workers always empty higher queues before lower ones.
# A single `critical` job jumps ahead of a 1,000-job `low` backlog.
[jobs]
queues = ["critical", "default", "low"]
```

```toml
# Weighted — fair draining that never starves a lower queue. Over a sustained
# mixed load each queue is served in proportion to its weight (here roughly
# 4 : 2 : 1), so `low` always makes forward progress even while `critical` has work.
[jobs.queues]
critical = 4
default = 2
low = 1
```

- **Strict** (`queues = [...]`) is the simple case: highest priority first, and a
  worker only pulls a lower queue when every higher queue is empty.
- **Weighted** (`[jobs.queues]` table) avoids starvation under sustained load:
  it uses smooth weighted round-robin, so each queue is the first choice in
  proportion to its weight over each cycle.

Routing is honored end-to-end on every backend (local, Redis, Postgres): the
queue is preserved through retries/backoff, dead-lettering, delayed enqueues, and
`enqueue_after_commit`. The actuator/admin job view shows each job's queue.

If a job declares a `queue` that is **not** in the configured drain list, that is
a loud, documented condition — it is logged at startup (`WARN`) and the queue is
appended at lowest priority so the job still drains instead of silently stalling.
Add the queue to `[jobs] queues` to control its priority.

> Out of scope (separate follow-ups): per-job-instance dynamic priority at
> enqueue time, and per-queue concurrency caps / dedicated worker pools.

## Uniqueness and concurrency limits

`#[job]` can declare dedup and in-flight caps directly, so double-submits and
bursts cannot duplicate side effects or overwhelm downstream systems — no
hand-rolled advisory locks in job bodies.

```rust,ignore
// At most one identical sync in flight: a burst of N identical enqueues
// runs exactly once. The key defaults to a stable hash of the full args.
#[job(unique)]
async fn sync_search_index(state: AppState, args: SyncArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> { … }

// Key by selected args fields, and cap simultaneous executions per account.
#[job(unique_by = "account_id", concurrency = 1, concurrency_key = "account_id")]
async fn recalculate_account(state: AppState, args: RecalcArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> { … }

// Debounce: coalesce repeat enqueues for 60s from the first enqueue,
// even after the job completed.
#[job(unique_for_ms = 60_000)]
async fn rebuild_report(state: AppState, args: ReportArgs) -> AutumnResult<()> { … }
```

Attributes:

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `unique` | Dedupe on a stable hash of the full args payload. |
| `unique_by = "a, b"` | Dedupe on the listed args fields (implies `unique`). |
| `unique_window = "running"` | Default: key held while the job is pending **or** running; released when it settles. |
| `unique_window = "pending"` | Key released when execution starts, so a new instance may queue while one runs. |
| `unique_for_ms = N` | TTL window: key held for `N` ms from enqueue (and while in flight on Postgres), even past completion. Mutually exclusive with `unique_window`. |
| `concurrency = N` | At most `N` simultaneously-executing jobs of this type. |
| `concurrency_key = "field"` | Scope the limit per distinct value of this args field. |

Semantics:

- A coalesced enqueue is a **no-op `Ok(())`**; it is counted as
  `total_deduplicated` in `/actuator/jobs` and recorded with the
  `deduplicated` job-admin status.
- Jobs over the concurrency cap **wait** (they stay enqueued/parked and run
  when a slot frees) — they are never dropped.
- Keys and slots are released on success, terminal failure, **and worker
  crash**: Postgres ties them to row status recovered by the visibility
  timeout; Redis settles them in the claim-validated transition and
  stale-recovery scripts, with a TTL backstop on lock keys.
- Enforcement is **distributed-safe** across replicas on the durable
  backends: Postgres uses a partial unique index plus `ON CONFLICT DO
  NOTHING` for dedup and (only when a limited job is registered) a
  transaction-scoped advisory lock around claims; Redis uses `SET NX PX`
  locks and atomic Lua claim/settle scripts.
- With neither attribute set, behavior is unchanged: no dedup and unbounded
  per-type concurrency.
- Retries keep a `running`-window key held (the job is still in flight) and
  re-acquire a `pending`-window key while waiting out the backoff; the
  concurrency slot is released during the backoff either way.
- After a pending-window job's first execution attempt, dedup is **best
  effort**: the key is released when execution starts (that is the window's
  contract), so a duplicate accepted while the job runs legitimately holds
  the key, and a retry or crash-recovered attempt then waits as pending
  without it. Workloads that must never overlap should use the default
  `running` window, which holds the key until the job settles.
- Operator actions respect uniqueness: canceling an enqueued job (including
  one parked behind a concurrency slot) releases its key immediately, and
  retrying a failed unique job re-takes the key — or fails with a clear
  conflict error when an equivalent job is already pending or running.
- On Redis, pending/running unique locks carry a 24-hour crash backstop TTL
  that is refreshed every time the job is claimed, retried, or recovered, so
  only a job left completely untouched for a full day can lose its lock.
- The Postgres backend needs the additive `autumn migrate` migration that
  adds the nullable `unique_key`/`unique_window`/`concurrency_key`/
  `concurrency_limit` columns; rows and jobs without them behave as before.

## Observability

Mount `autumn-admin-plugin` to get the built-in operator dashboard at
`GET /admin/jobs` (or the plugin prefix you choose). It lists enqueued, running,
recently completed, and failed jobs with retry/discard/cancel actions. See the
[Operating Background Jobs](operating-background-jobs.md) guide for dashboard
setup, action semantics, and bounded refresh behavior.

`GET /actuator/jobs` returns per-job:

- `queued`
- `in_flight`
- `blocked_on_concurrency`
- `total_successes`
- `total_failures`
- `dead_letters`
- `total_deduplicated`
- `last_error`

For Redis deployments these counters are process-local operational telemetry,
not a strongly consistent Redis aggregate. They remain useful for seeing queued,
in-flight, success, retry/failure, and dead-letter activity observed by the
replica serving the actuator request.

## Migration notes

When using `jobs.backend = "local"` or `jobs.backend = "redis"`, no SQL migration
is required.

When using `jobs.backend = "postgres"`, the `autumn_jobs` table must exist before
workers start. Run your app migrations as a one-shot `autumn migrate` job before
scaling web and worker replicas:

```bash
autumn migrate   # creates autumn_jobs, your domain tables, etc.
```

The migration is bundled with the framework and is applied automatically by
`autumn migrate` as long as the `db` feature is enabled.

## Transactional enqueue

When a job must be coordinated with a database write, choose the API based on
which guarantee you need:

- `enqueue_after_commit` prevents jobs for rolled-back data on any backend, but
  the post-commit callback is process-local and can be lost if the process exits
  after commit.
- `enqueue_in_tx` / `enqueue_on_conn` on the Postgres backend write the job row
  in the same transaction as the domain row, which is the crash-safe handoff.

### `enqueue_after_commit` — any backend

`autumn_web::job::enqueue_after_commit` registers the enqueue as an
after-commit callback inside the surrounding `db.tx` block. The job is only
dispatched if the transaction commits. Works with every job backend.

This is not crash-safe delivery. If the process exits after the transaction
commits but before the callback runs, no job may be recorded. Use this for
rollback coordination across backends, not as a durable outbox substitute.

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use scoped_futures::ScopedFutureExt;

async fn create_order(mut db: Db) -> AutumnResult<()> {
    db.tx(|conn| async move {
        // ... INSERT order ...

        // Enqueued only after INSERT commits; dropped if the tx rolls back.
        // For crash-safe Postgres handoff, use enqueue_in_tx instead.
        autumn_web::job::enqueue_after_commit("ship_order", &args).await?;

        Ok::<_, AutumnError>(())
    }.scope_boxed())
    .await
}
```

### `enqueue_in_tx` / `enqueue_on_conn` — Postgres backend only

On the Postgres backend the job row can live in the **same transaction** as
the domain row. Both commit or roll back together, avoiding the post-commit
process crash window at the cost of being limited to the `postgres` backend.

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use scoped_futures::ScopedFutureExt;

async fn create_order(mut db: Db) -> AutumnResult<()> {
    db.tx(|conn| async move {
        // ... INSERT order using conn ...

        // Job row written into the same transaction.
        autumn_web::job::enqueue_in_tx("ship_order", &args, conn).await?;

        Ok::<_, AutumnError>(())
    }.scope_boxed())
    .await
}
```

See [Transactions -> after_commit](transactions.md#after_commit--post-commit-process-local-callbacks)
for a full comparison of the two strategies and guidance on when to use each.

For cloud-native rollout run the migration job first, then start web and workers.
