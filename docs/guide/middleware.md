# Middleware in Autumn

Autumn ships a curated stack of built-in middleware — request IDs, security
headers, CSRF, [CORS](cors.md), sessions, metrics, exception filters. That covers the
boring-but-critical concerns most applications share. When you need something
off the beaten path (a timeout, a rate limiter, a custom tracing span, a
legacy header injector), you have several places to put it.

This guide explains **which hook to reach for**, where each one sits in the
stack, how to register it, and the common recipes.

---

## Which hook do I reach for?

Start here. Most "I need middleware" questions are answered by a row that is
not a tower layer at all.

| You want to… | Reach for | Scope | Why this one |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bound how long a request may take | `[server.timeouts] request_timeout_ms`, or `#[get(..., timeout_ms = N)]` | app / route | Built in. A hand-rolled `TimeoutLayer` gets the error shape, the counter, and the SSE/WebSocket exemptions wrong. |
| Throttle a caller | `#[throttle(...)]` | route | Built in, and keyed on the resolved client identity. See [rate limiting](./rate-limiting.md). |
| Require a logged-in user | `#[secured]` | route | Runs after the session layer, so it sees the session. |
| Decide *whether this actor may act on this record* | `#[authorize(...)]` | route | Policies need the loaded record; middleware runs before the handler and has none. See [authorization](./authorization.md). |
| Read something off the request in one handler | an **extractor** | handler | No layer needed. `ClientAddr`, `Session`, `CsrfToken`, `Query<T>`, your own `FromRequestParts`. See [extractors](./extractors.md). |
| Wrap **one route or a handful** in a tower layer | `#[intercept(MyLayer)]` | route | Per-route layering with no router surgery. See below for the path-only constraint. |
| Wrap **a URL-prefixed group** in a tower layer | `AppBuilder::scoped(prefix, layer, routes)` | group | One registration for `/api/*` without touching each handler. |
| Wrap **every** request | `AppBuilder::layer(..)` | app | Cross-cutting concerns that genuinely apply everywhere. |
| Redirect/reject **before a cached page is served** | `AppBuilder::static_gate(..)` | app, outermost | The only hook that runs ahead of the SSG/ISG cache. |
| Wrap something that is **not an HTTP request** — an outgoing mail, a job enqueue/execute, a DB checkout, a channel publish, an outbound HTTP call | `AppBuilder::with_*_interceptor(..)` | subsystem | Those pipelines never pass through the tower stack. See [non-HTTP interceptors](#non-http-interceptors-mail-jobs-db-channels-outbound-http). |
| Run logic around a **model save** | repository hooks | model | See [hooks and transactions](./hooks-and-transactions.md). |
| Ship the whole thing for someone else to install in one line | a `Plugin` | crate | See [extensibility](./extensibility.md). |

Two rules of thumb behind the table:

1. **Prefer the narrowest scope that works.** A layer on every request is a
   layer you pay for on `/health`, on `/static/*`, and on the error path. If
   only `/api/*` needs it, `scoped` says so in one line and the route listing
   (`autumn routes`) shows it.
2. **A layer cannot see handler state, and a handler cannot short-circuit a
   layer.** If your logic needs the loaded record, the resolved policy, or the
   deserialized body, it is not middleware — it is an extractor, a guard, or
   handler code.

---

## `#[intercept(...)]` — per-route tower layers

`#[intercept(PATH)]` attaches a [`tower::Layer`] to **one route**.

> **The argument must be a path, not a call.** The route macro parses it as a
> [`syn::Path`] and uses it directly as a value, so `MyLayer` works and
> `MyLayer::new(config)` does **not** — the latter fails to parse and the
> attribute is currently dropped **silently**, mounting no layer at all. Write
> the layer as a unit struct (or a `const`/`static` path) and have it read
> whatever it needs from application state at request time.

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

/// A unit-struct layer: nameable as a bare path, so the attribute accepts it.
#[derive(Clone)]
struct CacheExpensive;

#[get("/expensive")]
#[intercept(CacheExpensive)]
async fn expensive() -> &'static str {
    "computed once, served many"
}
```

Stack several by repeating the attribute. They compose like
[`tower::ServiceBuilder`]: **the first attribute is the outermost layer**, so it
sees the request first and the response last.

```rust,ignore
#[get("/reports/{id}")]
#[intercept(TenantLayer)]     // outermost: runs first on ingress
#[intercept(CacheExpensive)]  // innermost: closest to the handler
async fn report(Path(id): Path<i64>) -> Markup { /* … */ }
```

Because the argument cannot carry configuration, a layer that needs some has two
options: read it from `State<AppState>`/an extension inside the service, or use
`AppBuilder::scoped`, whose layer **is** an ordinary expression and can capture
anything.

### When `#[intercept]` is the right answer

Reach for it when **all** of these hold:

- the behaviour is genuinely per-request wrapping — it needs to see the request
  before the handler runs *and* the response after, or it needs to
  short-circuit and never call the handler at all;
- it applies to a specific route (or a few), not the whole app;
- it is expressible as a tower layer over the whole request/response.

Response caching is the canonical case: `CacheResponseLayer` must return a
stored response *without* running the handler, which no extractor can do.
Per-route auth *shape* (a bearer-token layer on API routes while the browser
routes keep session cookies) is the second most common.

### When to use something else instead

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| The logic only *reads* the request and hands a value to the handler | an extractor — cheaper, testable as a plain function, visible in the handler signature |
| Every route needs it | `AppBuilder::layer` — one registration instead of an attribute per handler |
| Every route under one prefix needs it | `AppBuilder::scoped` — same, and `autumn routes` reports the group |
| It must run before a pre-rendered page is served | `static_gate` — `#[intercept]` sits inside the static cache and never runs on a cache hit |
| It is an authorization decision about a record | `#[authorize]` |
| It is a deadline, a throttle, or a security header | the built-in config knobs — see the table above |

### Trade-offs worth knowing before you reach for it

- **A non-path argument is silently ignored.** `#[intercept(MyLayer::new(..))]`
  compiles and mounts nothing. Verify a new interceptor actually runs (a log
  line, a test asserting its header) rather than assuming the attribute took —
  this matters most for a layer whose whole job is to *reject* requests.
- **`#[intercept]` is incompatible with `#[edge]`.** Interceptor layers are
  origin-only tower middleware; combining the two is a compile error, because
  the edge capsule has no tower stack to host the layer.
- **An intercepted route opts out of implicit idempotency replay.** Because a
  layer may legitimately produce a different response than the handler alone,
  such a route fails closed and requires an explicit replay scope rather than
  inheriting one. See [idempotency](./idempotency.md).
- **It stacks inside the framework stack, not outside it.** Session, CSRF,
  error pages, and metrics have already run by the time your layer sees the
  request — which is usually exactly what you want.
- **Bounds are the standard tower bounds** (`Clone + Send + Sync + 'static`,
  `Service::Error = Infallible`). Wrap fallible layers in
  [`axum::error_handling::HandleErrorLayer`], as shown further down.

## Non-HTTP interceptors (mail, jobs, DB, channels, outbound HTTP)

A tower layer only sees inbound HTTP. Four other pipelines never touch it, and
each has its own interceptor trait installed on the builder:

| Builder method | Trait | Wraps |
|---|---|---|
| `with_mail_interceptor` | `MailInterceptor` | every outgoing `Mail` delivery |
| `with_job_interceptor` | `JobInterceptor` | every job enqueue **and** every job execution |
| `with_db_interceptor` | `DbConnectionInterceptor` | checkouts through `Db::checkout` — see the caveat below |
| `with_channels_interceptor` | `ChannelsInterceptor` | publishes through the app's `Channels` registry |
| `with_http_interceptor` | `HttpInterceptor` | outbound requests sent through `auth::HttpClient` — see the caveat below |

None of these means *every* without qualification, and the gaps share a shape:
each hook is installed on the thing the framework hands you, so anything
constructed outside that registry — or running outside a request — escapes it.
`with_mail_interceptor` wraps the configured `Mailer`'s transport,
`with_channels_interceptor` the `AppState` `Channels` registry; a `Mailer` or
`Channels` your own code builds is untouched by either. The two worth spelling
out:

`DbConnectionInterceptor` sees only checkouts made through `Db::checkout` (the
`Db` extractor and the shard-routed paths). The scheduler and the job runtime
take connections straight from the pool, so a hook used for auditing or fault
injection will not observe them. It is a request-path tool.

`HttpInterceptor` is the one to read the fine print on. Only
`auth::HttpRequestBuilder::send` consults the interceptor list, and that type
lives behind the `oauth2` feature — so a request made through the SSRF-guarded
`Client` extractor, or through a `reqwest::Client` your own code built, does not
run it. It is a hook on the OAuth path, not a chokepoint for arbitrary outbound
traffic; if you need every call audited, that has to come from routing calls
through a named client (see the [outbound HTTP guide](./outbound-http.md)), not
from registering this.

They all share the "around" contract — you receive the operation plus a `next`,
and decide whether, when, and how to invoke it — but **`next` comes in two
forms, and the difference decides what you can build**:

| `next` is | Traits | You can |
|---|---|---|
| an owned `Pin<Box<dyn Future>>` | `MailInterceptor`, `JobInterceptor`, `DbConnectionInterceptor` | await it **once**, or drop it to suppress the operation |
| a callable `&dyn Fn(..)` | `ChannelsInterceptor`, `HttpInterceptor` | invoke it zero, one, or **many** times, **and choose what to pass** |

The first three are *observe* hooks, not rewrite hooks. The owned future has
already captured its operation — the mail to send, the job payload, the
checkout — so nothing in the signature reaches inside it. Such an interceptor
can wrap, time, refuse, or log a job; it cannot edit the payload that gets
enqueued, and it cannot retry, because nothing there builds a second attempt.
To retry a mail send or a job, use the subsystem's own retry policy.

`ChannelsInterceptor` and `HttpInterceptor` take the operation as *arguments*
to `next` — `next(topic, message)` and `next(request)` — so those two can do
what the others cannot: rewrite what gets published or sent, call `next` more
than once to retry, or not at all to drop it.

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::interceptor::JobInterceptor;

struct TracingJobs;

impl JobInterceptor for TracingJobs {
    fn intercept_enqueue<'a>(
        &'a self,
        name: &'a str,
        payload: &'a serde_json::Value,
        next: std::pin::Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = AutumnResult<()>> + Send + 'a>>,
    ) -> std::pin::Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = AutumnResult<()>> + Send + 'a>> {
        Box::pin(async move {
            tracing::info!(job = name, "enqueuing");
            next.await
        })
    }

    fn intercept_execute<'a>(
        &'a self,
        _name: &'a str,
        _payload: &'a serde_json::Value,
        next: std::pin::Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = AutumnResult<()>> + Send + 'a>>,
    ) -> std::pin::Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = AutumnResult<()>> + Send + 'a>> {
        next
    }
}

autumn_web::app()
    .with_job_interceptor(TracingJobs)
    .run()
    .await;
```

Unlike `.layer()`, these are **last-one-wins installs**, not a stack: a second
`with_job_interceptor` replaces the first. Compose inside a single interceptor
if you need two behaviours. `DbConnectionInterceptor` is also how the test
harness implements transactional test isolation, which is why it carries an
`is_transactional_test` marker.

## Built-in request timeout

You do **not** need a tower layer for a per-request deadline — Autumn ships one.
Set a single config key and a hung handler returns a framework-standard `503`
(Problem Details JSON for API clients, the HTML error page for browsers) and
frees its worker, instead of letting one slow request starve the pool:

```toml
# autumn.toml
[server.timeouts]
request_timeout_ms = 30000  # 0 or unset disables the deadline
```

Override at runtime with `AUTUMN_SERVER__TIMEOUTS__REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`. The
`prod` profile smart-defaults this to `30000` (30s), so a fresh `autumn new` app
is production-safe with **zero** user-written tower layers; `dev` leaves it off.

A timeout emits structured telemetry — a `request_timeouts_total` counter plus a
`tracing` warning (target `autumn::timeout`) carrying the `route` template and
`elapsed_ms` — so you can alert on it.

### What the deadline covers

The deadline bounds the time to produce the **response head**, not the duration
of body streaming. So **SSE and chunked/streaming responses are exempt** — once
the head is sent, the body is never interrupted mid-stream. WebSocket upgrades
(`#[ws]`) follow the same rule: the pre-upgrade handshake (any async auth or
setup that runs before the upgrade response) counts against the deadline, but the
**established socket is never interrupted** — it is handed off after the head is
sent. `#[static_get]` **build-time and ISR regeneration** renders are exempt
automatically (they run with no inbound client request to bound), but **live**
requests that fall through to the dynamic handler — a cache miss, no `dist`, or a
path absent from the manifest — are bounded like any other route.

**Long-poll handlers are the exception**: because they block *before* returning
the response head (waiting for an event), that wait counts against the deadline
and the request will 503 once it elapses. Give such routes an explicit
`timeout = "off"` (see below) if a poll may legitimately outlast the deadline.

**Idempotent mutations are also bounded.** A mutating request carrying an
`Idempotency-Key` has its full response body buffered (so the response can be
cached and replayed) before the head is returned, so even a streamed body counts
against the deadline. Give such endpoints a per-route override if they
legitimately produce slow or large idempotent bodies.

### Per-route overrides

Extend the deadline for known-slow endpoints, or disable it entirely, right on
the route — no manual tower wiring:

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

// Large report export: allow up to two minutes.
#[get("/reports/export", timeout_ms = 120000)]
async fn export() -> &'static str { "…" }

// Intentionally long-lived: exempt from the global deadline.
#[get("/events", timeout = "off")]
async fn events() -> &'static str { "…" }
```

> **WebSocket routes inherit only.** `#[ws]` does not accept `timeout_ms` /
> `timeout = "off"`. The handshake is always bounded by the global
> `request_timeout_ms` and the established socket is never bounded (see above).
> If a handshake needs a different bound, wrap the async auth/setup inside the
> upgrade handler with `tokio::time::timeout`.

> **SSG/ISG outer layers are not bounded.** When a `dist` manifest is active,
> `AppBuilder::static_gate` layers and `AppBuilder::layer` custom layers run
> *outside* the deadline (it sits inside the dynamic router, inner to
> `RequestId`, so cached hits and the gate never reach it). A hung async
> `static_gate` — e.g. remote auth — is therefore not capped by
> `request_timeout_ms`; bound it with a layer-level or server/proxy read
> timeout. Live requests that fall through to the dynamic handler are bounded
> normally.

---

## Quick start: any tower layer

When you need something off the beaten path, [`AppBuilder::layer`] drops in any
standard [`tower::Layer`]. For example, adding a *different* tower layer (here a
raw `TimeoutLayer`, though for request deadlines prefer the built-in above):

```rust,no_run
use std::time::Duration;
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use axum::{error_handling::HandleErrorLayer, http::StatusCode};
use tower::{ServiceBuilder, timeout::TimeoutLayer};

#[get("/slow")]
async fn slow() -> &'static str {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;
    "done"
}

#[autumn_web::main]
async fn main() {
    autumn_web::app()
        .routes(routes![slow])
        .layer(
            ServiceBuilder::new()
                .layer(HandleErrorLayer::new(|_| async {
                    StatusCode::REQUEST_TIMEOUT
                }))
                .layer(TimeoutLayer::new(Duration::from_secs(5))),
        )
        .run()
        .await;
}
```

Tower's `TimeoutLayer` surfaces its own `BoxError` on timeout, while axum
requires every layer to produce `Infallible`. `HandleErrorLayer` bridges the
two — it converts any error from the inner layer into an HTTP response. (The
built-in request timeout already handles all of this for you.)

---

## Middleware ordering

On a request's **ingress** path (outermost → innermost), layers run in this
order:

```
  TraceContext / ServerTiming + AccessLog fallbacks / StartupBarrier
    └─ SecurityHeaders                     ← framework-outermost
         └─ [your .static_gate() calls]
              └─ Compression
                   └─ Metrics
                        └─ ExceptionFilter
                             └─ ErrorPageContext
                                  └─ Session
                                       └─ RequestId
                                            └─ LogContext
                                                 └─ ServerTiming / AccessLog (primary)
                                                      └─ Reporting (panic catch)
                                                           └─ Timeout
                                                                └─ TrustedProxies
                                                                     └─ [your .layer() calls, first = outermost]
                                                                          └─ BodyLimit
                                                                               └─ Maintenance / LoadShed
                                                                                    └─ RateLimit
                                                                                         └─ CSRF
                                                                                              └─ CORS
                                                                                                   └─ [your .scoped() layer, for routes in that group]
                                                                                                        └─ [your #[intercept] layers, first attribute = outermost]
                                                                                                             └─ route handler
```

Config-gated layers (Compression, ServerTiming, AccessLog, Timeout, RateLimit,
CSRF, CORS, LoadShed, …) are absent entirely when their feature is off. The
canonical, exhaustive list — including the ones this diagram abbreviates — lives
in a comment in `autumn/src/router.rs`'s `apply_middleware`; that comment is the
source of truth if the two ever disagree.

`LogContext` establishes the request-scoped log context (request id
correlation for every log line); it sits inside `RequestId` so the id is
always available, and outside your layers so events they emit are correlated.
The structured per-request access line (`autumn::access`) is emitted by the
**primary** `AccessLog` layer just inside `LogContext`, so the line is
correlated to the request span and carries the request id. Responses that
short-circuit above it — session-store outages, and in production startup
503s, pre-built static page hits, and the MCP endpoint — are caught by the
outermost **fallback** `AccessLog`, which logs them with the wire status (and
without a request id, since `RequestIdLayer` never ran for them).

The ordering guarantee that matters most: **in a fully dynamic build, user
layers run inside `RequestIdLayer` on ingress**, so every `.layer()` you
register can read the generated `RequestId` from the request extensions.
Exception filters, metrics, and error-page rendering all sit *outside* your
layers, which means errors you produce (and errors you let bubble up from
handlers) are still caught by Autumn's error pipeline.

Multiple `.layer()` calls stack in registration order, mirroring
[`tower::ServiceBuilder`]: the first `.layer(A)` call becomes the outermost
user layer, so `A` sees the request first and the response last.

Registrations are type-erased at `.layer(..)` time and composed into a single
application, so the tenth layer you register costs the framework no more
per-request work than the first — app-wide layers no longer deepen the stack
that every request clones its way down. One consequence shows up in the bound:
your layer is composed against Autumn's own erased ingress service rather than
`axum::routing::Route`, which any layer written generically over the service it
wraps — every standard tower layer — already satisfies.

---

## Wrap shared state in `Arc`

Because `AppBuilder::layer()` requires the layer to be `Clone + Send + Sync +
'static`, any state your middleware needs to share across requests — HTTP
client pools, metrics registries, rate-limit stores, caches — should live
behind an [`Arc`]. Clone the layer; the `Arc` cheaply bumps a refcount.

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;

#[derive(Clone)]
struct MetricsLayer {
    registry: Arc<prometheus::Registry>, // shared, cheaply clonable
}
```

Trying to store the raw `prometheus::Registry` directly would force every
request-handling clone to deep-copy the registry (if it were `Clone` at all)
and would fail the `Sync` bound outright for types like `RefCell`. `Arc`
sidesteps both issues.

## Reading the request ID from a custom layer

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::middleware::RequestId;
use axum::http::Request;

fn log_with_id<B>(req: &Request<B>) {
    if let Some(id) = req.extensions().get::<RequestId>() {
        tracing::info!(request_id = %id, "custom layer fired");
    }
}
```

Because user layers sit inside `RequestIdLayer`, the extension is always
present in `call(..)` — there's no race condition to worry about.

---

## Gating cached pages with `static_gate`

When you pre-render routes (SSG) or revalidate them on a schedule (ISG), the
cached HTML is served by Autumn's static-first middleware **before** the inner
router — session, auth, and your `.layer()` calls — is ever reached. That is
what makes static hits fast and keeps them available even if the session
backend is down, but it also means the framework's auth layers cannot gate a
pre-rendered response: the same HTML is served to every visitor regardless of
auth state.

`AppBuilder::static_gate` is Autumn's answer to this, analogous to Next.js
*Edge Middleware* (`middleware.ts`) running before the CDN cache lookup. A gate
layer runs **outermost** — outside the session layer and ahead of the static
cache — so it can redirect or reject a request before a cached page is served:

```
static_gate (auth check / redirect)
  └─ static cache lookup
       └─ pre-rendered page served (or regenerated for ISG)
            └─ … session, your .layer() calls, route handler …
```

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use axum::{
    extract::Request,
    http::{header, Method, StatusCode},
    middleware::Next,
    response::Response,
};

async fn require_auth(req: Request, next: Next) -> Response {
    // Only gate page navigation: let non-GET/HEAD requests (JSON APIs, form
    // POSTs, the `/mcp` JSON-RPC transport, CORS preflights) pass through so a
    // browser redirect never turns them into a 302.
    let is_page = matches!(req.method(), &Method::GET | &Method::HEAD);
    // Verify a signed/JWT session cookie DIRECTLY — the session Extension is
    // not available this far out in the stack.
    if !is_page || has_valid_session_cookie(req.headers()) {
        next.run(req).await
    } else {
        Response::builder()
            .status(StatusCode::FOUND)
            .header(header::LOCATION, "/login")
            .body(axum::body::Body::empty())
            .unwrap()
    }
}

autumn_web::app()
    .routes(routes![dashboard])
    .static_gate(axum::middleware::from_fn(require_auth))
    .run()
    .await;
```

Key properties and trade-offs:

- **Runs before the static cache** in SSG/ISG mode, so cached pages can be
  auth-gated without baking user-specific content into the pre-rendered HTML.
- **Runs in the same outermost position in fully-dynamic mode** (no `dist/`
  directory), so the same gate behaves identically whether or not static
  generation is active — gating code is portable.
- **No session `Extension`.** The session layer runs *inside* the gate, so you
  cannot read session-populated extensions here. Verify a signed session cookie
  or JWT directly, using the same signing key you configure for sessions.
- **Personalised content still needs a dynamic route** (or client-side fetch).
  `static_gate` decides *whether* to serve a cached page, not *what* it
  contains.
- **Page-cache gate, not API auth.** The gate is global, so a well-behaved gate
  should no-op on non-GET/HEAD requests (note the `is_page` check above) — a
  browser redirect is meaningless for a JSON API or the `/mcp` JSON-RPC POST
  transport, and the gate is never applied to MCP `tools/call` dispatch anyway.
  Authenticate JSON APIs and MCP tools with route-level guards / `#[secured]` /
  session auth.
- Multiple `static_gate` calls stack in registration order (first =
  outermost), like `.layer()`. Plugins can pre-flight with
  `has_static_gate::<L>()` / `get_static_gate_types()`.

## Scope, side by side

The three tower-layer registrations differ only in *what they wrap*:

| Registration | Wraps | Position among user layers |
|---|---|---|
| `#[intercept(L)]` | the annotated route | innermost — inside `.scoped` and `.layer` |
| `.scoped(prefix, L, routes)` | the routes in that group | between `.layer` and `#[intercept]` |
| `.layer(L)` | every request | outermost user position (see the diagram above) |
| `.static_gate(L)` | every request, **ahead of the static cache** | outside the framework stack entirely |

All four take the same `tower::Layer` bounds, so a layer written for one can be
moved to another without changing its code — only the registration line moves.

## Limitations (for now)

- **`Service::Error = Infallible`.** Any layer you register must produce
  `Infallible` on its service's `Error` associated type. For layers that
  surface real errors (timeouts, rate limits, circuit breakers), wrap them
  with [`axum::error_handling::HandleErrorLayer`] as shown above.
- **`#[intercept]` and `#[edge]` are mutually exclusive.** Interceptor layers
  are origin-only; an edge capsule has no tower stack to host one, so the
  combination is refused at compile time.
- **Non-HTTP interceptors are last-one-wins.** `with_job_interceptor` and its
  siblings replace rather than stack. Compose inside one implementation.

## Recipes

### Rate limiting with `tower-governor`

```rust,ignore
use tower_governor::{governor::GovernorConfigBuilder, GovernorLayer};

let governor_conf = GovernorConfigBuilder::default()
    .per_second(10)
    .burst_size(20)
    .finish()
    .unwrap();

autumn_web::app()
    .routes(routes![index])
    .layer(GovernorLayer::new(governor_conf))
    .run()
    .await;
```

### Extra tracing span per request

```rust,ignore
use tower_http::trace::TraceLayer;

autumn_web::app()
    .routes(routes![index])
    .layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http())
    .run()
    .await;
```

### Custom header injection (legacy system integration)

Write a small `Layer`/`Service` pair (see the pattern in
`autumn/tests/custom_layer.rs`) that rewrites or inserts request/response
headers, then register it with `.layer(MyLayer)`. Because the layer sits
inside `RequestIdLayer`, you can stamp the request ID onto any outgoing
header for downstream services.

## Forwarded-header client identity (plugin author guidance)

When writing middleware that needs the real client IP, hostname, or scheme,
**never read `X-Forwarded-*` headers directly.** Direct reads are fragile,
bypass the operator's trust policy, and can introduce SSRF / IP-spoofing
vulnerabilities. Use the blessed extractors instead:

| Extractor | What it resolves |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `ClientAddr` | Real client IP after trust evaluation |
| `ClientHost` | External host (`X-Forwarded-Host` or `Host`) |
| `ClientScheme` | External scheme (`X-Forwarded-Proto` or URI scheme) |

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::extract::{ClientAddr, ClientHost, ClientScheme};
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

#[get("/info")]
async fn info(
    ClientAddr(ip): ClientAddr,
    ClientHost(host): ClientHost,
    ClientScheme(scheme): ClientScheme,
) -> String {
    format!("client={ip} host={host} scheme={scheme}")
}
```

The values are resolved once per request by the framework's
`TrustedProxiesLayer`, using the operator's `[security.trusted_proxies]`
configuration. Middleware written inside the framework stack can read
`ResolvedClientIdentity` directly from request extensions:

```rust,no_run
use autumn_web::security::ResolvedClientIdentity;

// Inside a Tower Service::call:
let identity = req.extensions().get::<ResolvedClientIdentity>();
```

See [`security.trusted_proxies` configuration](../guide/getting-started.md)
for operator setup instructions.
