# Search: keyword and vector (`autumn-search`)

Autumn ships full-text search *primitives* in core: the `#[searchable]` model
attribute, a Postgres `tsvector` column, and a `#[repository(searchable)]`
`search()` method. That covers "search this table."

`autumn-search` is the **subsystem** on top: declare a model searchable, get an
index that stays in sync as records change, and query it — by keyword or by
semantic similarity — through one engine-agnostic API. It is an optional plugin
crate; an app that never installs it pays nothing.

- **Crate:** `autumn-search`
- **Issue:** [#1191](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues/1191)
- **Builds on:** [#842](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues/842)
  (in-core FTS), which it subsumes as one backend rather than replacing.
- **Example:** `examples/wiki` mounts the plugin on `Page` — the same model
  `docs/guide/full-text-search.md` already uses for the in-core primitive —
  via `wiki::search_plugin()` (`src/lib.rs`). `PageHooks` (`src/hooks.rs`)
  composes the reindex calls into its existing hooks rather than replacing
  them (see "Keep the index in sync" below), and `GET /api/v1/search`
  (`src/routes/pages.rs`) is the plugin-backed sibling of the hand-rolled
  `/search` route, hydrated back into real `Page` rows.

## 1. Mark a model searchable

```rust
#[autumn_web::model]
#[searchable(language = "english")]
pub struct Article {
    #[id]
    pub id: i64,

    #[searchable(weight = "A")]
    pub title: String,

    // `embed` nominates the field whose text is embedded for vector search.
    #[searchable(weight = "B", embed)]
    pub body: String,

    pub tenant_id: Option<String>,
}
```

`#[searchable]` is the single source of truth. From it, `#[model]` derives an
`IndexDefinition` (index name, language dictionary, weighted field list, embed
field) and a per-record `SearchDocument`. You never write either by hand.

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `#[searchable]` on the struct | the model has a search index; language defaults to `simple` |
| `#[searchable(language = "english")]` | text-search dictionary |
| `#[searchable]` on a field | index it at the lowest weight (`D`) |
| `#[searchable(weight = "A")]` | index it at weight `A` (A > B > C > D) |
| `#[searchable(embed)]` | **also** embed this field for vector search |

Rules the macro enforces at compile time:

- at most **one** `embed` field — a record has one embedding, so two is
  ambiguous rather than last-wins;
- `embed` requires the model-level `#[searchable]`;
- `#[encrypted]` and `#[searchable]` remain mutually exclusive (#805).

A `#[searchable]` model whose primary key is not `i64` keeps its #842 behaviour
and simply has no plugin index — search indexes key on `i64`.

A `deleted_at` column is **not** by itself treated as a tombstone. The index
follows the repository: `#[repository(..., soft_delete)]` makes the source
exclude deleted rows, matching the finders, while a `deleted_at` kept as audit
history leaves them indexed — also matching the finders. Inferring from the
column alone would hide records the app still displays.

The key **column** does not have to be called `id`. `#[id] pub note_id: i64` is
carried into the index definition as `key_column`, and the Postgres document
source selects, filters, and paginates on it — so a model over a legacy table
that still has an unrelated `id` column backfills correctly rather than keying
half its documents off the wrong value.

A `tenant_id` column of type `String` / `Option<String>` is picked up
automatically: its value is carried into every document. Whether the index is
**tenant-scoped** follows `#[repository(..., tenant_scoped)]`, not the column —
same rule as `soft_delete`, because a denormalized or audit `tenant_id` on an
unscoped repository has unscoped finders, and the index must not be more
restrictive than the reads it mirrors. Querying a tenant-scoped index with no tenant in
scope is then `SearchError::TenantContextMissing`, not a search across every
tenant — the same posture `#[repository(tenant_scoped)]` takes, and it is what
protects the paths that are easy to forget (a route mounted outside the tenancy
layer, a `#[job]`, a background task).

A model with no `tenant_id` column is unaffected and needs no tenant scope. If
a model has a `tenant_id` column that is *not* a tenant (a device id, say),
register a definition with the flag cleared:

```rust
let mut definition = Reading::index_definition();
definition.tenant_scoped = false;
SearchPlugin::new().index_definition(definition)
```

---

## 2. Keep the index in sync

```rust
use autumn_search::SearchSyncHooks;

// `#[repository]`'s `hooks =` takes a plain type NAME, not a generic type
// expression, so alias the generic first.
type ArticleSearchHooks = SearchSyncHooks<Article, NewArticle, UpdateArticle>;

#[autumn_web::repository(Article, hooks = ArticleSearchHooks, commit_hooks = true)]
pub trait ArticleRepository {}
```

Create, update, and delete now enqueue a durable reindex job. `commit_hooks =
true` writes the intent to Autumn's commit-hook queue **inside the same
transaction as the mutation**, so a rolled-back transaction never leaves a
phantom document and a process dying between commit and enqueue is recovered by
the queue rather than lost.

If the repository already has hooks, compose instead of replacing — call
`autumn_search::enqueue_reindex_for(&record)` (or `enqueue_unindex_for`) from
your own `after_*_commit`.

> **Known gap: `restore()` and `purge()`.** `#[repository(soft_delete)]` also
> generates `restore(id)` and `purge(id)`, and both write to the table directly
> without running `MutationHooks`. No reindex is enqueued for either, so a
> restored record stays missing from the index and a purged one can stay
> searchable, until the next mutation or a backfill. The fix belongs in the
> repository macro; until then, call `enqueue_reindex_for` / `enqueue_reindex`
> yourself after either call. Because the handler re-reads the row, sending
> either instruction converges correctly regardless of which one you send.

### Why the job payload is `(index, id)` and not the record

A reindex instruction carries the index name and the primary key. The handler
**re-reads the row** — for a delete as much as an upsert:

- row present ⇒ upsert the document;
- row absent (hard-deleted, or soft-deleted and therefore filtered out by the
  source) ⇒ delete the document.

Every instruction is the same operation: *converge this id*. So create, update,
delete, a replayed job, a lost delete event, and a row changed by direct SQL all
reach the same index state, in any order. At-least-once delivery is safe by
construction, a stale payload can never write stale text into the index, and a
late delete cannot evict a record that has since been recreated under the same
primary key. It is also what makes the `(index, id)` dedup key sound: repeated
writes collapse to one job precisely because the ops are interchangeable.

`ReindexOp` survives as intent, and as the one place the paths differ: with no
`DocumentSource` installed a delete still removes the document (it needs
nothing to re-read), while an upsert reports `SourceUnavailable`.

Convergence needs one more thing to hold on a multi-worker deployment. The
dedup key is released when a job **starts**, not when it finishes — otherwise a
write landing mid-reindex would be swallowed and the index would keep the
pre-write text. That means two jobs for one record can be in flight at once,
and because each re-reads the source they can interleave badly: A reads, a
write lands, B reads and writes the new state, then A writes the old one. So
the reindex job also carries a **concurrency cap of one per record**
(`(index, id)`, not per job type — distinct records still reindex fully in
parallel). The follow-up job is still enqueued immediately; it just waits for
the running one, then re-reads and converges.

---

## 3. Mount the plugin

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use autumn_search::SearchPlugin;

autumn_web::app()
    .plugin(
        SearchPlugin::new()
            .postgres()                       // FTS + pgvector backend
            .embedder(Arc::new(MyEmbedder))   // your provider
            .visibility(Arc::new(MyVisibility))
            .index::<Article>()               // one line per searchable model
            .index::<Note>(),
    )
    .routes(routes![...])
    .run()
    .await;
```

Adding a searchable model is one builder line: the reindex job is keyed on the
*index name*, not the model, so there is no per-model job, handler, or
generated glue.

### Configuration

```toml
[search]
queue = "search"            # the #[job] queue reindex/backfill run on
batch_size = 500            # rows per backfill batch
enabled = true              # false ⇒ index writes are no-ops, queries empty
embedding_dimensions = 768  # declared width; enables the pgvector fast path
```

The plugin reads the config itself at boot, so `enabled = false` is the
incident switch it claims to be: a config change, not a deploy — and it stops
index writes (including a purging backfill) without failing writes to the
model. A disabled subsystem also **initializes nothing**: no `ensure_index`, no
DDL, no embedder width check. That is the difference between a kill switch and
a preference — an unreachable engine or a revoked DDL grant must not still
abort application startup once you have turned search off. Pass `SearchPlugin::config(...)` to configure in code instead; doing so
also stops the file being read.

`[search]` is resolved through the **same profile layering the runtime uses**,
so a per-environment switch works the way you would expect:

| Layer | Wins over |
|---|---|
| `autumn.toml` `[search]` | — |
| `[profile.<name>.search]` in `autumn.toml` | the base section |
| `autumn-<profile>.toml` `[search]` | the inline profile section |
| `AUTUMN_SEARCH__QUEUE` / `__BATCH_SIZE` / `__ENABLED` / `__EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | every file |

```toml
# Search off in production, on everywhere else.
[profile.prod.search]
enabled = false
```

The active profile comes from `AUTUMN_ENV` → `AUTUMN_PROFILE` → `--profile` →
`AUTUMN_IS_DEBUG=0` ⇒ `prod` → `dev`, exactly as core resolves it, and each
filename is looked up through `AUTUMN_MANIFEST_DIR` before the working
directory. A plugin that read only the base `autumn.toml` would silently ignore
the kill switch in the one environment you reach for it.

Both of those last two values are read through core's `Env` abstraction rather
than the raw process environment, because neither is necessarily a real
variable: `#[autumn_web::main]` supplies the crate directory and the build mode
at compile time. Reading `std::env` directly would see a release binary as
`dev` — skipping `[profile.prod]` — and would miss the app's own config
whenever the binary runs from anywhere but its crate root.

An unknown key under `[search]` is an **error**, not a warning — a typo'd
`queu = "indexing"` would otherwise silently leave indexing on the default
queue with no signal at all. A malformed value in an `AUTUMN_SEARCH__*` var is
ignored instead: a bad env var must not take down a process that would boot
fine on its file config.

`embedding_dimensions` is checked against the installed `Embedder` at startup.
If they disagree the app **refuses to boot**, because the alternative is
silent: every index write succeeds, the vector column rejects the wrong-width
value, and semantic search returns nothing forever.

---

## 4. Query it

The plugin installs the client as an `AppState` extension, so a handler reaches
it the same way it reaches a `BlobStore`:

```rust
let search = state
    .extension::<autumn_search::SearchClient>()
    .expect("SearchPlugin is installed");
```

```rust
// Ranked + paginated keyword search, as an ordinary `Page`.
let page: Page<SearchHit> = search.search::<Article>("rust web", &page_req).await?;

// Driven by a request's ListQuery + PageRequest, so search drops into an
// existing index endpoint with no second query-parameter vocabulary.
let page = search.search_list::<Article>("rust web", &list, &page_req).await?;

// Turn hits back into records; ranked order is re-applied for you.
// The loader returns `SearchResult<Vec<Article>>`; an `AutumnError` from a
// repository call converts with `?`, so this is the whole loader.
let page: Page<Article> = search
    .search_hydrated::<Article, _, _>("rust web", &page_req, |ids| async move {
        Ok(repo.find_all(&ids).await?)
    })
    .await?;

// Semantic search over the `embed` field.
let hits = search.similar::<Article>("how do I add auth?", 5).await?;
let neighbours = search.similar_to::<Article>(article.id, 5).await?;
```

### Query semantics (the cross-backend contract)

Query text is a **bag of words**, not a query language:

- every token must be present for a document to match (AND);
- operator-looking input (`OR`, `field:`, `*`, quotes) is never interpreted as
  syntax;
- a blank or punctuation-only query returns an **empty page having issued no
  query** — never a full scan.

That keeps results consistent across engines and makes a hostile query string
structurally incapable of widening the result set. The Postgres backend
implements it with `plainto_tsquery`, which is parameterized and cannot be
injected into.

> This is deliberately narrower than `#[repository(searchable)]`'s `search()`,
> which uses `websearch_to_tsquery` and *does* honour `OR` / quoted phrases /
> `-` negation. The in-core method is a Postgres-specific convenience; the
> plugin's contract has to hold for every engine.

Hits carry identity (`index`, `id`, `score`), never record contents — the index
never becomes a second, staler copy of your database that can leak columns.

---

## 5. Authorization

A search index is a second read path over the same rows, so it needs the same
posture as a normal query.

```rust
use autumn_search::{BoxFuture, SearchError, SearchFilter, SearchVisibility};
use autumn_web::authorization::PolicyContext;

struct ArticleVisibility;

impl SearchVisibility for ArticleVisibility {
    fn filter<'a>(
        &'a self,
        ctx: &'a PolicyContext,
        _index: &'a str,
    ) -> BoxFuture<'a, Result<SearchFilter, SearchError>> {
        Box::pin(async move {
            Ok(match ctx.user_id.as_deref() {
                Some(user) => SearchFilter::default().equals("author_id", user),
                // Fail closed, exactly like `Scope`'s default empty list.
                None => SearchFilter::default().allow_ids(Vec::<i64>::new()),
            })
        })
    }
}
```

Then query through the authorization-aware entry points:

```rust
let page = search.search_for::<Article>(&ctx, "rust web", &page_req).await?;
let hits = search.similar_for::<Article>(&ctx, "rust web", 5).await?;
```

Four properties make this enforceable rather than advisory:

1. `SearchFilter` is a **required argument** of the backend query methods, not
   a post-processing step, so page totals and neighbour counts are computed
   *after* the restriction and a backend cannot quietly skip it.
2. Filters **intersect** (`SearchFilter::intersect`), so a caller-supplied
   filter can only ever narrow what authorization allowed. Two incompatible
   constraints collapse to "match nothing", never to an arbitrary winner.
3. A visibility hook that returns an error **aborts** the search. There is no
   fall-back-to-unfiltered path.
4. Calling `search_for` with no hook registered is
   `SearchError::VisibilityUnavailable` — a wiring mistake surfaces instead of
   silently returning everything.

Because a `SearchFilter` is plain data, an out-of-scope engine (Meilisearch, a
vector store) receives the same tenant/visibility restriction. The ambient
tenant from `CURRENT_TENANT` is intersected into **every** query automatically,
and `similar_to` filters the *seed* read as well as the neighbour query — an
unfiltered seed read would be an inference channel, letting a caller rank their
own probe documents against a record they cannot see.

---

## 6. Backfill

For bootstrapping and after a schema change:

```bash
autumn search reindex                     # every registered index
autumn search reindex --index articles    # one index
autumn search reindex --purge             # clear each index first
autumn search reindex --profile prod      # rebuild prod's index
```

The CLI compiles the application binary and runs it with
`AUTUMN_SEARCH_BACKFILL` set — the same "run the app, it knows its own wiring"
technique `autumn jobs manifest` uses. It has to be the app: the indexes,
backend, and embedder are registered at runtime by your own builder call, so a
standalone CLI cannot see them.

Programmatically, or from a job:

```rust
let report = search.backfill("articles", &BackfillOptions::default()).await?;
let reports = search.backfill_all(&BackfillOptions::default().purge(true)).await?;
```

The backfill walks the source with **keyset** pagination
(`WHERE <key> > $after ORDER BY <key>`), never `OFFSET`, so a live table's
concurrent writes cannot make it skip or repeat rows. It writes through the
exact same path as an incremental reindex, so bootstrapping and steady state
cannot disagree.

A backfill takes a **write watermark** before its first batch and never
overwrites — or re-creates — a record touched after that point. Deletes are
recorded in a ledger that outlives the document, because once the row is gone
there is nothing left for a conditional write to compare against, and an
unguarded insert would resurrect something a user deleted. Removing the
document and recording the delete happen in **one statement** — they are two
halves of a single fact, and a backfill that observed the gap between them
would see neither the document nor the tombstone. Without it, a backfill batch —
read minutes ago, then delayed by an embedding round-trip — would clobber
whatever a per-record reindex wrote in the meantime, and nothing re-runs that
reindex. Newer always wins, so the bulk and per-record writers converge without
knowing about each other. A backend that does not report
`BackendCapabilities::conditional_index` ignores the watermark and keeps
last-writer-wins.

It stops only on an **empty** batch, never on a short one. `DocumentSource::scan`
returns *up to* `limit` documents, so a source that filters after reading —
soft-deleted rows, a tenant check, an empty embed field — legitimately returns
a short batch with rows still behind it. Stopping there would truncate the
rebuild and report success.

`--profile` matters more than it looks. The reindex works by running your
application binary — only the app knows which indexes, backend, and embedder
are registered — and that binary resolves its own `[search]` section. The CLI
builds a **debug** binary, which core reads as the `dev` profile when no
selector is set, so a production rebuild has to say `--profile prod` or it will
rebuild (or purge) the development index and report success. The CLI prints the
profile it is using for exactly that reason.

`purge` is off by default: emptying the index is the wrong trade for a routine
repair run. Turn it on when documents the source no longer produces would
otherwise survive forever.

---

## 7. Backends

| Backend | Keyword | Vector | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PostgresSearchStore` | `tsvector` + `setweight` + `ts_rank_cd` | `pgvector`, or a portable `double precision[]` fallback | production |
| `MemorySearchBackend` | in-process, weighted | in-process cosine | dev and tests — no Docker, no network |
| your `impl SearchBackend` | — | — | Meilisearch, Tantivy, a vector store |

### The Postgres index

Documents live in one framework-owned table, `autumn_search_documents`, keyed
`(index_name, record_id)` — not in each model's own `search_vector` column.
That buys three things the per-table column cannot:

- the index is **engine-agnostic**: swapping engines changes the backend, not
  every model's migration;
- it is **observable and repairable**: count, diff, and purge the index without
  touching the system of record;
- backfill and incremental reindex write through the **same** path.

Your model's own `#[searchable]` column and `#[repository(searchable)]`
`search()` are untouched.

Ranking passes the framework's own weight array to `ts_rank_cd`
(`{D, C, B, A}` = `{0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0}`, the normalized form of
`weight_factor`'s `1/2/5/10`) rather than taking Postgres' default
`{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0}`. The two differ only at `B` — which is the weight a
body field usually carries, so leaving it defaulted would rank Postgres
differently from `MemorySearchBackend` on the most ordinary model there is,
and the two suites assert they implement the *same* contract.

### `pgvector`, and life without it

`ensure_index` probes for the `vector` extension. When it is installed **and**
`search.embedding_dimensions` is set, embeddings go to a `vector(N)` column
with an ivfflat index and k-NN uses the `<=>` cosine-distance operator.
Otherwise they go to a `double precision[]` column ranked by an
`autumn_search_cosine()` SQL function created by the same schema.

Same API, same ordering, different speed — so the plugin is deployable on a
managed Postgres without `pgvector`, and gets the fast path for free where it
exists. A failed `CREATE EXTENSION` degrades; it never aborts boot.

A **filtered** k-NN query deliberately does not use the ivfflat index. ivfflat
picks its candidate lists by distance before the `WHERE` clause runs, so a
selective tenant or visibility predicate can leave the probed lists holding
few or none of the rows the caller may see — returning short, or empty, while
qualifying neighbours sit in unprobed lists. Since those filters are usually an
authorization boundary, a filtered query orders by the derived similarity
instead, which forces an exact scan. Unfiltered queries keep the fast path.

---

## 8. Embeddings

`autumn-search` orchestrates embeddings. It ships **no model, no inference
runtime, and no vendor SDK** — that is explicitly out of scope. Implement
`Embedder`:

```rust
use autumn_search::{BoxFuture, Embedder, SearchError, SearchResult};

struct MyEmbedder { /* an HTTP client, a local runtime, … */ }

impl Embedder for MyEmbedder {
    fn dimensions(&self) -> usize { 768 }

    fn embed<'a>(&'a self, texts: &'a [String]) -> BoxFuture<'a, SearchResult<Vec<Vec<f32>>>> {
        Box::pin(async move {
            // one provider round-trip per batch; one vector per input, in order
            todo!()
        })
    }
}
```

Two implementations ship, and neither is a model:

- **`NoEmbedder`** — the default. Refuses, so an app that never configured
  embeddings gets a typed `EmbedderUnavailable` at *query* time rather than
  meaningless vectors. Keyword indexing still works; a missing provider must
  not fail writes.
- **`HashingEmbedder`** — a deterministic, dependency-free hashing vectorizer.
  Real lexical embeddings for development and for tests that must not reach the
  network. It is honest about what it is: no semantics beyond token overlap.

`dimensions() == 0` means "no embeddings available": the client skips embedding
while indexing and errors on a semantic query.

---

## 9. Errors

`SearchError` is typed, and `into_autumn_error()` maps it to the right status:

| Variant | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VectorUnsupported`, `DimensionMismatch` | 400 | the caller asked for something this index cannot answer |
| `UnknownIndex`, `EmbedderUnavailable`, `VisibilityUnavailable`, `SourceUnavailable`, `TenantContextMissing`, `InvalidIndex`, `Unsupported`, `Embedding`, `Backend` | 500 | a configuration gap or a genuine failure |

Every message names the builder call that fixes it.

---

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- a bundled embedding model or inference runtime — see §8;
- faceting, typo tolerance, synonyms, and highlighting beyond what a backend
  offers natively;
- cross-model / federated ranking fusion — indexes are per-model;
- a full RAG pipeline (chunking, prompt assembly, LLM calls). This is the
  retrieval layer.
