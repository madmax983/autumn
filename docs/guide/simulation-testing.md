# Simulation Testing

Autumn ships a **deterministic simulation testing (DST)** harness: a `#[sim_test]`
attribute that hands your test a seeded [`Sim`] handle, a paused deterministic
executor, and a virtual clock, so your whole app's concurrency — retries,
scheduled ticks, background jobs — runs identically on every machine and every
run. A failure prints a copy-pasteable line that reproduces it exactly, and a
seed-sweep runner (`sweep_proptest`, see below) lets you drive *your own*
workload against many seeds looking for rare-interleaving bugs a single-seed
test would never stumble into. **This sweeping is opt-in, not automatic**:
autumn's own CI runs a built-in `sim-sweep` job as a smoke check of the
harness mechanism itself (a small, fixed toy scenario over a few hundred
seeds) — it does not explore your application's interleavings. Wiring
`sweep_proptest` against your own scenario, in your own CI, is how you get
that coverage for your app; see "Property-based op-driving + the seed sweep"
below.

## Why simulation testing

The nastiest production bugs are not logic errors in a single handler — they
are *interleaving* bugs: a retry storm when a downstream stalls, a deadlock
between a request and a scheduled tick, a timeout that fires in the wrong
order. These bugs need many actors racing at the same instant to trigger, so a
real-clock test would need to get impossibly lucky to reproduce one — and even
luckier to rerun it to prove a fix. A deterministic simulation makes "many
actors racing at the same instant" the cheap, constructible *default*: pause
the clock, drive everything from one seed, and the same instant is trivial to
manufacture on purpose.

## Quick start

`#[sim_test]` needs no extra feature flag — it's part of the default `autumn-web`
surface.

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::Sim;
use autumn_web::sim_test;

#[sim_test]
async fn deterministic(mut sim: Sim) {
    // The seed comes from `AUTUMN_SIM_SEED` (hex `0x..` or decimal), default 0.
    // `sim`'s own clock and RNG (`sim.rng()`) are pure functions of this seed.
    // An app mounted with `sim.build(...)` gets the virtual clock and an
    // entropy source seeded from it, so its ids replay too.
    assert_eq!(sim.seed, 0);
}
```

Reproduce a failing run by copying the replay line printed on panic:

```text
AUTUMN_SIM_SEED=0x9f3a cargo test -p my-crate deterministic
```

### Mounting a real app

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::Sim;
use autumn_web::sim_test;
use autumn_web::test::TestApp;

#[sim_test]
async fn app_boots_under_the_sim(mut sim: Sim) {
    sim.build(
        TestApp::new()
            .routes(routes![index])
            .jobs(jobs![send_receipt])
            .tasks(tasks![nightly_digest]),
    );

    let response = sim.client().get("/").send().await;
    response.assert_ok();
}
```

`sim.build` mounts an [`autumn_web::app::AppBuilder`]-configured app on the
sim's paused runtime. It wires in the virtual clock, an entropy source seeded
from `sim.seed` (see "Deterministic identifiers" below), and the
fault-injection hooks below if you configured any. Register `#[job]`s with
`TestApp::jobs` and `#[scheduled]` tasks with `TestApp::tasks`, or through a
plugin, exactly as on `AppBuilder`.

### Virtual time

```rust
sim.advance(std::time::Duration::from_secs(24 * 3600)).await; // 24h, zero wall-clock sleep
sim.run_to_idle().await; // drain everything the advance released
```

- [`Sim::advance`] steps the injected [`autumn_web::time::Clock`] and tokio's
  paused timer wheel together, so a `#[job]`'s exponential backoff or a
  `#[scheduled]` tick fires the instant virtual time crosses its deadline —
  with zero real waiting. `sim.build` starts the app's scheduled tasks, so an
  `every = "1m"` task first ticks one virtual minute after `build`, and a
  `cron` task at its next occurrence after the sim epoch.
- [`Sim::run_to_idle`] drains everything already-ready — the job worker, due
  scheduler ticks, durable repository commit hooks — until the runtime is
  quiescent. It does **not** fast-forward to a future timer; pair it with
  `advance` for "jump to the next interesting instant, then settle what fired."
  The drain runs 1024 rounds, then stops at 64 quiet rounds in a row. If it
  sees no such quiet run within 2048 rounds (for example, a job that enqueues
  itself again), `run_to_idle` panics with a `sim drain stall` message and the
  seed. `Sim::try_run_to_idle` returns the `SimStall` instead.
- [`Sim::advance_to`] / [`Sim::advance_to_local`] jump to a specific
  (optionally timezone-zoned, DST-aware) instant instead of a raw duration —
  useful for business-calendar / SLA tests that must cross a spring-forward or
  fall-back boundary deterministically.

### Deterministic identifiers

Framework-minted IDs (job IDs, request IDs, idempotency keys, session tokens)
draw from an injected [`autumn_web::entropy::Entropy`] source. Reach a seeded
one from a handler via the [`autumn_web::entropy::Rng`] extractor, or from the
sim directly via `sim.rng()`.

`Sim::build` seeds the mounted app's entropy from `sim.seed`, so a job's retry
jitter, a minted UUID and anything else reading `state.entropy()` replay from
`AUTUMN_SIM_SEED` with no extra call. The default is the same source as
`with_entropy(SeededEntropy::new(sim.seed))`. To use a different source, pass
your own; an explicit `with_entropy` always wins:

```rust
use autumn_web::entropy::SeededEntropy;

sim.build(
    TestApp::new()
        .routes(routes![index])
        .with_entropy(SeededEntropy::new(0xfeed)),
);
```

An app mounted again after [`Sim::kill`] (a restart) gets a new stream derived
from the seed, so the restarted process does not repeat the crashed one's ids
and the run still replays.

Before 0.8.0 the default was the OS entropy source, and a test had to pass
`with_entropy(SeededEntropy::new(sim.seed))` itself. That call still works and
now changes nothing.

### Fault injection

`Chaos` injects faults **probabilistically** — you give it a rate and the seed
decides which operations get hit:

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::Chaos;

sim.chaos(
    Chaos::default()
        .db_transient_errors(0.05)     // 5% of connection checkouts fail
        .job_duplicate_delivery(0.10)  // occasional at-least-once double-delivery
        .clock_skew(std::time::Duration::from_millis(250)),
);
```

Every fault decision is drawn from the seed, so enabling chaos never breaks
reproducibility — the same seed replays the same fault schedule. See
[`autumn_web::sim::Chaos`] for the full catalog, including SMTP transport
faults. Two related tools sit outside `Chaos`: `sim::llm`'s seeded LLM stub
for agent retry paths, and [`Sim::kill`] / [`Sim::restart`] for
crash-recovery proofs. A kill drops the app between two drains, after its
transactions commit, not in the middle of one. When you want to *name* a fault rather than sample
one — "fail the 3rd database checkout" — reach for `FaultPlan` in the next
subsection instead.

### Authored fault scenarios (`FaultPlan`)

`Chaos` is a *rate*: "5% of checkouts fail", with the seed choosing which ones.
That is the right shape for a sweep hunting rare interleavings, and the wrong
shape for a regression test — because the sentence a post-mortem actually
produces is "the **third** connection checkout failed while the **second**
`send_invoice` execution was retrying", and no probability reproduces that on
purpose. [`autumn_web::sim::FaultPlan`] lets you author that scenario directly,
by ordinal rather than by rate, and hands back a serializable record of what
happened that a test can assert on and CI can replay byte-for-byte.

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::{FaultPlan, Sim};
use autumn_web::sim_test;
use autumn_web::test::TestApp;

#[sim_test]
async fn the_third_checkout_and_the_second_invoice_fail(mut sim: Sim) {
    let plan = FaultPlan::from_seed(sim.seed)
        .fail_db_checkout(3)           // 3rd checkout on any pool (ordinals are 1-based)
        .fail_job("send_invoice", 2);  // 2nd execution of that job by name

    sim.build(
        TestApp::new()
            .routes(routes![checkout])
            .plugin(InvoiceJobPlugin)
            .with_fault_plan(plan),
    );

    for _ in 0..5 {
        sim.client().post("/checkout").send().await;
    }
    sim.run_to_idle().await; // drains the job worker through the fault seam

    let outcome = sim.client().fault_outcome().await;

    assert_eq!(outcome.fired.len(), 2);
    assert_eq!(outcome.fired[0].ordinal, 3);            // the checkout that failed
    assert_eq!(outcome.server_errors[0].status, 503);   // captured through reporting
    assert_eq!(outcome.final_state.db_checkouts, 5);    // every checkout, fired or not

    // Canonical, byte-identical on every replay of this seed — commit it as a
    // fixture and this scenario becomes a CI regression test.
    assert_eq!(outcome.to_json_string(), include_str!("fixtures/invoice_scenario.json").trim_end());
}
```

Ordinals are **1-based**, and `0` matches nothing (the same convention as
`Chaos::smtp_faults`). `fail_db_checkout(n)` and `fail_job_execution(n)` count
across every pool and every job name; `fail_db_checkout_on("replica", 2)` and
`fail_job("send_invoice", 2)` count on that target's own counter. Duplicate
entries collapse, so a plan is a set — `plan.planned()` returns the whole
schedule sorted and `plan.describe()` prints it one fault per line, both before
you run anything. A plan is pure data: clone it onto two apps and you get two
independent ledgers.

Faults can be confined to a window of virtual time, driven by the injected
clock rather than wall time:

```rust
let plan = FaultPlan::from_seed(sim.seed)
    .fail_job_execution(2)
    .only_between(Duration::from_secs(5), Duration::from_secs(10));
```

The window is half-open (`from <= elapsed < to`) and `elapsed` is measured on
the app's injected monotonic clock since the app started — so `sim.advance`
moves it and no real time ever does. Outside the window the effect still
consumes its ordinal, and the near-miss is recorded in `outcome.suppressed`
rather than vanishing: a scenario that stopped firing because your timings
shifted is visible in the outcome instead of silently passing.

The seed earns its keep in the `random_*` lane, which spreads faults across a
range instead of naming each one:

```rust
let plan = FaultPlan::from_seed(0x5EED).random_db_checkout_faults(2, 1..=8);
```

That picks 2 distinct checkout ordinals from `1..=8` using the plan's seed, and
resolves them into explicit entries *at builder-call time* — so `planned()`
still describes the schedule completely, a different seed picks different
checkouts, and a plan built only from explicit `fail_*` calls draws no entropy
at all.

#### What the outcome record holds

| Field | Contents |
|---|---|
| `seed` | the plan's seed, echoed so an outcome identifies its own replay |
| `fired` | `Vec<FiredFault>` in fire order: `effect`, `target` (pool or job name), the global `ordinal`, the `target_ordinal`, `at` (injected wall clock) and `elapsed_ms` (injected monotonic) |
| `suppressed` | matched an ordinal but fell outside `only_between` |
| `unfired` | planned faults the run never reached, sorted — an empty list (together with an empty `suppressed`) is the proof your scenario actually exercised what it authored; a near-miss outside the window counts as reached, so check `suppressed` too |
| `server_errors` | 5xx captured through `reporting.rs`, in report order: `status`, `method`, `route`, `message`, `problem_type`. Deliberately **no** request ID — it is entropy-minted, and the record has to stay comparable |
| `final_state` | seam totals: `db_checkouts`, `job_executions`, `job_executions_failed`, `job_executions_succeeded` |

`to_json_string()` is canonical (declaration-order fields, no maps, no floats),
`fingerprint()` is an FNV-1a 64 over that string, and `FaultOutcome::from_json_str`
round-trips it. `TestClient::fault_outcome()` is `async` because autumn
dispatches error reports on a detached task: it settles those with bounded
cooperative yields before snapshotting, and never advances the virtual clock
while doing so. `TestClient::fault_ledger()` returns the same handle for an
un-settled `outcome()` snapshot, and `None` when no plan was attached.

#### The determinism contract

The byte-identical-replay guarantee holds inside a specific box, and `build`
enforces the parts it can:

- **A paused, current-thread runtime** — `#[sim_test]`, or
  `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]`. On a multi-threaded runtime concurrent
  executions race for their ordinals and the ordering is not reproducible.
- **The injected clock.** Window checks and every `at` / `elapsed_ms` read the
  app's `ClockSource`, so no wall-clock read leaks into the record.
- **Seeded entropy.** Attaching a plan defaults the app's entropy to
  `SeededEntropy` derived from the plan's seed, so retry jitter and minted IDs
  replay from it too. Unlike the rest of the sim this one *is* automatic — an
  explicit `with_entropy` still wins.
- **One job worker** (`jobs.workers = 1`), **reporting at
  `sample_rate = 1.0`**, and **failure capture off** (the default). `build`
  asserts all three when a plan is attached, rather than letting a second
  worker, a sampled-out 5xx, or a capsule write that reporting awaits before
  any reporter runs quietly break replay.

#### What it does not cover

- **Only two effect classes**: database connection checkout and job execution.
  Mail, outbound HTTP and channels have no `FaultPlan` lane — for SMTP use
  `Chaos::smtp_faults`, which already takes an explicit 1-based schedule.
- **Test-only.** `FaultPlan` attaches to a `TestApp`; there is no production
  fault injection, by design.
- **`perform_enqueued_jobs` bypasses it.** `TestClient::perform_enqueued_jobs`
  invokes handlers directly and never crosses the `intercept_execute` seam, so
  job faults never fire under it. Drain with `sim.run_to_idle()` — plus
  `sim.advance` to cross a retry backoff — instead.

`autumn/tests/integration/sim_fault_plan.rs` carries the worked example, in the
same before/after shape as the retry-storm bug above: a `charge_card` job and a
plan that fails its first execution. With `max_attempts = 1` the charge is never
recorded and the scenario's resilience assertion fails; with `max_attempts = 3`
the retry lands it exactly once and the same plan passes — flip that one
attribute back to reproduce the failure. See issue
[#1680](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues/1680) for the design.

### `always!` / `sometimes!`

```rust
use autumn_web::{always, sometimes};

always!(total_balance == 0, "ledger must stay zero-sum (seed={:#x})", sim.seed);
sometimes!(response.status() == 409, "a transfer was rejected (insufficient funds)");
```

- `always!` is a **hard invariant** — it panics the instant its condition is
  false, exactly like `assert!`, but the panic flows through `#[sim_test]`'s
  replay-line printing.
- `sometimes!` is a **reachability target** — it records whether the labeled
  condition was ever true. A single run doesn't fail just because a
  `sometimes!` was never satisfied (call
  [`autumn_web::sim::assert_all_sometimes_satisfied`] for an explicit
  single-run check); the seed-sweep runner below fails the *sweep* if a label
  was observed but never satisfied by any seed in the range — so a green sweep
  is provably non-vacuous, never accidentally testing nothing.

### Property-based op-driving + the seed sweep

Behind the `sim-testing` feature (`dep:proptest`), `sim::op` and `sim::sweep`
add a proptest-driven workload generator and a batch seed runner:

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::{Sim, sweep_proptest, SweepOutcome};

let strategy = proptest::collection::vec(any::<Op>(), 1..32);
match sweep_proptest(0..1000, &strategy, |sim, ops| apply_ops(sim, ops)) {
    SweepOutcome::Passed { seeds_run } => println!("{seeds_run} seeds, non-vacuous"),
    SweepOutcome::Failed { failure, .. } => panic!("{failure}"), // shrunk to a minimal op-sequence
    SweepOutcome::Vacuous { unsatisfied, .. } => panic!("never satisfied: {unsatisfied:?}"),
    SweepOutcome::Empty => panic!("swept zero seeds"),
}
```

`sweep_proptest` runs [`Sim::run_proptest`] sequentially across every seed in
the range, stopping at the first failure and reporting its seed plus a
proptest-shrunk minimal op-sequence.

**This is a library function you call from your own `[[bin]]` or test, driven
against your own `Strategy`/`body` for your own app's properties** — nothing
runs it for you automatically. Autumn's own repository ships one example of
wiring it up: `autumn/src/bin/sim_sweep.rs`, a small `[[bin]]` that sweeps a
fixed, deliberately-correct toy account scenario as a smoke check that the
sweep mechanism itself works (`sim_sweep_driver`'s DoD test proves it catches
a real invariant break using a deliberately-buggy variant of the same toy
scenario). Autumn's own CI runs that binary as its own job (`Sim sweep`,
structured like the `loom` job, 512 seeds) on every push and
PR — but that job exercises the harness, not your application. To get this
coverage for your own app, write a `[[bin]]` following the same shape against
your own scenario and wire it into your own CI.

```bash
AUTUMN_SIM_SEEDS=1000 cargo run -p autumn-web --release --features sim-testing --bin sim-sweep
```

`AUTUMN_SIM_SEED_START` sets the first seed (default `0`). On a failure the
binary prints a replay command that sets both variables to rerun only the
failing seed, for example
`AUTUMN_SIM_SEED_START=300 AUTUMN_SIM_SEEDS=1 cargo run …`.

### Catching a deadlock

A deadlock parks every task with no timer that could wake one, so by default
a deadlocked `#[sim_test]` hangs. Set `AUTUMN_SIM_LIVENESS_BUDGET_SECS` to arm
a watchdog: a virtual-time timeout around the test body. Because the paused
runtime advances straight to the next timer when every task is parked, a
deadlock reaches the watchdog in microseconds of real time, and the test fails
with a `sim liveness` panic and its replay line.

```bash
AUTUMN_SIM_LIVENESS_BUDGET_SECS=31536000 cargo test -p my-crate sim_ -- --test-threads=1
```

The watchdog is off by default because of how the paused clock works: it also
advances while a task waits on something outside the runtime, such as a lock
that a test on another thread holds, or real I/O. So arm it only where sim
tests run one at a time (`--test-threads=1`) and do no real I/O. A busy loop
that never parks keeps the runtime from advancing, so the watchdog does not
detect it; an `always!` invariant is the tool for that. Autumn's own CI arms
the watchdog on its single-threaded `sim_` step.

### Crash at any await

`crash_at(index, op)` runs `op` and drops it at its `index`-th suspension
point (an await that returns `Pending`). A re-poll with no new wake does not
count, so the index is the same inside `Sim::interleave`. The work before that
point stays
done. The work after it never runs. Then call `sim.kill()` and
`sim.restart(app)` to model the process dying there.

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::{crash_at, CrashOutcome};

let point = sim.crash_point().unwrap(); // seeded
let outcome = crash_at(point.await_index, sim.client().post("/transfer").send()).await;
if outcome.is_crashed() {
    sim.crash_and_restart(app_on_the_same_db());
    sim.run_to_idle().await; // recovery runs here
}
```

To test every crash point, increase `index` from 0 until the outcome is
`CrashOutcome::Completed`.

### Interleaving shuffler

Tokio polls ready tasks in a fixed order. The shuffler changes that order from
the seed, so a sweep explores task interleavings, not only timer and fault
orders.

```rust
let client = sim.client();
let ops = vec![client.post("/reserve").send(), client.post("/reserve").send()];
let responses = sim.interleave(ops).await; // seeded poll order
let handle = sim.spawn(async { /* … */ }); // seeded yields
```

- `Sim::interleave` polls the futures in a seeded order each round, and can
  hold one back for a round. A request's handler runs inside its future, so
  handler awaits are reordered too.
- `Sim::spawn` spawns a task that can yield before a poll, which moves it
  behind the other ready tasks.

The same seed replays the same interleaving. Tasks that the framework spawns
itself (job workers, scheduled loops) keep tokio's order.

### Simulated network

`SimNet` replaces the real network for outbound calls through
`http_client::Client`:

```rust
use autumn_web::sim::SimNet;

let net = SimNet::new()
    .host("payments", payments_router()) // an in-process axum::Router
    .latency(Duration::from_millis(5), Duration::from_millis(80))
    .drop_rate(0.1);
sim.net(net.clone());
sim.build(TestApp::new().routes(routes![checkout]));

net.partition("payments"); // calls to http://payments/… fail at once
net.heal("payments");
let log = net.events(); // one NetEvent per attempt
```

- Latency is seeded, in virtual time. A drop fails the attempt after its
  latency. The client's retry policy applies: attempts, backoff, 429
  `Retry-After`, 502-504 retries and `request_timeout`.
- A host with no router falls back to the app's `http_mock`s. A host with
  neither is an error. No call reaches the real network.
- The same seed records the same `events()`.

Only a `Client` built from the app state (the `Client` extractor or
`Client::from_state`) uses the network, and only after `sim.net(..)`. It needs
the `http-client` feature. Like http mocks, a sim call skips the process-global
circuit breaker, the SSRF checks, `pin_to` and redirect following.

### Fuzzing the shared scenario

Autumn's `sim-sweep` bin and its `sim_ops` cargo-fuzz target drive one `Op`
vocabulary. Random seeds and coverage-guided search then look at the same
state space. An op sequence moves between them: encode a shrunk sweep failure
as a fuzz input, and decode a fuzz crash into ops for a test.

```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run sim_ops
```

The built-in scenario is correct by design, so both are smoke checks of the
harness. For your own app, use the same shape: one `Op` type, a proptest
strategy for the sweep, and a byte decoder for a fuzz target.

---

## Worked example: a real retry-storm bug

The harness's value isn't hypothetical — it caught a genuine bug in autumn's
own job runtime. The local job runtime's retry backoff computed a pure
exponential delay, `initial_backoff_ms * 2^(attempt - 1)`, with **no jitter**.
That delay depends only on a job's *configuration*, not its identity — so when
several jobs in the same queue fail at the same instant (a downstream
dependency blips and takes every in-flight job down with it), every one of
them computes the *identical* delay and retries at the *identical* instant: a
synchronized "thundering herd" that immediately re-floods the dependency it
just backed off from.

A real-clock integration test can't reproduce this on purpose — it would need
N real jobs to fail within the same millisecond of wall time, a coincidence no
ordinary test schedule can force. Under the sim's virtual clock it's the
opposite: "N jobs fail at the same instant" is the deterministic, trivial
condition, because the paused runtime never lets real time elapse between
enqueuing them.

```rust
#[sim_test]
async fn retries_are_not_synchronized_under_load(mut sim: Sim) {
    // The retry jitter reads `state.entropy()`, which `sim.build` seeds
    // from `sim.seed` (see "Deterministic identifiers" above).
    sim.build(TestApp::new().plugin(StormProbeJobPlugin));

    for id in 0..STORM_SIZE {
        StormProbeJob::enqueue(StormArgs { id }).await.unwrap();
    }
    sim.run_to_idle().await;                    // every job fails, "at once"

    // Step through the backoff window in bounded checkpoints, recording
    // which checkpoint each retry lands in as it drains. A single big
    // `sim.advance(Duration::from_millis(1_500))` looks tempting here, but
    // both the injected `ClockSource` and Tokio's own paused clock jump
    // straight to their target instant in one step *before* any timer
    // fires — so every retry woken by that one big advance would read the
    // *same* post-advance `now()` regardless of its individual delay,
    // silently hiding a real spread (or a real herd) behind a single
    // observed instant. Checkpointing avoids that: each drain only sees
    // the retries whose delay fell inside that specific step.
    for step_ms in [550, 100, 100, 100, 100, 550] {
        sim.advance(Duration::from_millis(step_ms)).await;
        checkpoint += 1;
        sim.run_to_idle().await;                // records `checkpoint` on each retry that lands here
    }

    let distinct_checkpoints = /* … collected from the drained retries … */;
    always!(
        distinct_checkpoints > 1,
        "all retries landed in the same checkpoint of the backoff window — a thundering herd"
    );
}
```

Before the fix, this `always!` fired on every seed: every retry landed in the
same checkpoint. The fix draws an *equal-jitter* spread — a random delay in
`[ceil(base_delay / 2), base_delay]` — from the framework's injected `Entropy`
seam, so the herd spreads out using real OS entropy in production while
staying bit-for-bit reproducible under a fixed sim seed (the ceiling keeps a
small configured backoff, like `backoff_ms = 1`, from rounding down to an
immediate 0ms retry). See
`autumn/tests/integration/sim_retry_storm.rs` for the full test and
`jittered_retry_delay_ms` in `autumn/src/job.rs` for the fix.

## A worked example in an app

`examples/reddit-clone/tests/sim_hot_rank.rs` is the smallest complete shape of
an application `#[sim_test]`: it mounts a route on the sim's paused runtime,
walks 48 virtual hours in checkpoints, and asserts the app's hot-rank decay
curve through the ordinary [`Clock`] extractor rather than around it. It uses
`always!` for the hard invariants and `sometimes!` for reachability, and it
arranges two deliberately-separated input bands so that
[`assert_all_sometimes_satisfied`](https://docs.rs/autumn-web/latest/autumn_web/sim/assert/fn.assert_all_sometimes_satisfied.html)
holds at every seed — the pattern to copy when you want a single-run
non-vacuity check rather than a sweep.

## What's virtualized (and what isn't)

| Source | Sim treatment |
|---|---|
| Wall-clock time (`Utc::now()` via the `Clock` extractor) | Virtual, driven by `Sim::advance` |
| Async timers (`tokio::time::sleep`, job backoff, scheduler ticks) | Virtual, via a paused current-thread Tokio runtime |
| Elapsed / monotonic time (`state.monotonic()`, the `Clock` extractor's `.monotonic()`) | Virtual, driven by `Sim::advance` — but a raw `std::time::Instant` is **not** (see below) |
| Scheduling of autumn's own background work (jobs, scheduler, commit hooks) | Deterministic, drained by `Sim::run_to_idle` |
| Framework-minted IDs (job IDs, request IDs, idempotency keys, sessions) | Seeded from `sim.seed` via the `Entropy` seam |
| Database | **Boundary** — real in-process SQLite, fault-injected at the connection level via `Chaos` (by probability) or `FaultPlan` (by checkout ordinal), not simulated at the SQL-dialect level |
| Framework code with no clock in scope | Virtual, through the ambient clock (`time::ambient_now` and its siblings) |
| Outbound HTTP through `http_client::Client` | Simulated by `SimNet` after `sim.net(..)`: in-process hosts, seeded latency and drops, partitions |
| Task-poll order | Tokio's order, or seeded with `Sim::interleave` / `Sim::spawn` |
| Other third-party network (SMTP, LLM calls) | **Boundary** — mocked/fault-injected via `Chaos`/`sim::llm`, not simulated |

### Keeping your own code deterministic

Tokio's paused runtime virtualizes `tokio::time::Instant` — **not**
`std::time::Instant`. So a handler or job that measures how long something took
with `std::time::Instant::now()` reads the real machine clock even inside a
`#[sim_test]`, and two runs of the same seed disagree. Read time through the
seams instead:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `chrono::Utc::now()` | `state.clock().now()`, or the `Clock` extractor in a handler |
| `std::time::Instant::now()` (measuring elapsed) | `clock.monotonic()` for the start (the extractor snapshots at request start) and `state.monotonic()` for the closing read, then `MonotonicInstant::saturating_duration_since` |
| `std::time::Instant::now()` (a deadline whose counterparty is `tokio::time::sleep`) | `tokio::time::Instant::now()` — already virtual under the paused runtime |
| `std::time::SystemTime::now()` | `autumn_web::time::clock_unix_secs(clock)` / `clock_unix_duration(clock)` |
| `uuid::Uuid::new_v4()` | `state.entropy().uuid_v4()`, or the `Rng` extractor in a handler |
| Any of the time reads above, with no clock in scope | `autumn_web::time::ambient_now()`, `ambient_monotonic()`, `ambient_instant()`, `ambient_system_time()` — these read the running `Sim`'s clock on this thread, else the system clock |

Each `Sim` has its own elapsed-time timeline, and the system clock is another
one. `ambient_monotonic()` readings are comparable only within one timeline.
`ambient_instant()` joins the timelines one after the other: a `Sim` starts its
instants at the latest instant already given out in the process. So state that
outlives one `Sim` sees the next one's instants as later, and its TTLs and idle
ages run on. After a nested `Sim` ends, the outer one's instants go on from
where the nested one stopped, so on one thread an ambient instant never goes
back. Instants from code outside the sim, or from a `Sim` on another thread, are
not ordered this way: do not share state that stores ambient instants (a cache,
a presence map) with those.

If you write a custom `impl ClockSource` whose `now()` is virtual, you **must**
also override `monotonic()`. The trait ships a default body that reads the real
process-monotonic clock — that keeps every pre-existing implementation compiling
and behaving exactly as before, but it means a virtual clock that forgets to
override it silently reports real elapsed time.

The framework holds itself to the same rule on the modules listed in
`scripts/check-determinism-gate.sh`, where a clippy deny-lint enforces it; see
CONTRIBUTING.md's "Determinism seam gate" for the enforced subset and the parts
of the framework that are not on the seam yet.

A sim-only green run proves your orchestration, timing, ordering, and identity
logic — it is **not** a substitute for testcontainer integration tests against
real Postgres, and it does not simulate SQL-dialect or isolation-level
behavior. See issue [#1797](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues/1797)
for the full design rationale and determinism boundary.
