# Verify What You're Running

Every Autumn release artifact — and every production image the scaffold builds
— ships with two things an auditor can check without trusting anyone's word:

- a **CycloneDX SBOM**: the exact list of crates compiled into the artifact.
- a **build-provenance attestation**: a keyless [Sigstore][sigstore] signature
  binding that artifact's digest to the repository, commit, and CI run that
  produced it.

Nothing here needs third-party supply-chain tooling, a signing key, or a
subscription. This page is meant to be followed verbatim; every command is
runnable as written.

## What you need

| Tool | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [`gh`][gh] ≥ 2.49 | `gh attestation verify` | `brew install gh` / [other platforms][gh] |
| `autumn` | reading SBOMs out of binaries | `cargo install autumn-cli` |
| `docker` | only for the container image sections | — |

`gh attestation verify` needs to be authenticated (`gh auth login`) so it can
read the attestation from GitHub's transparency log.

## Part 1 — verifying an Autumn release

Every asset attached to an Autumn GitHub Release carries a provenance
attestation: the CLI archives, their `.sha256` files, and the release SBOM.

### 1.1 Download an asset

SBOM assets and attestations exist from the first release that ships this
feature onward, so take the tag from the release list rather than hardcoding
one:

```bash
TAG=$(gh release list --repo autumn-foundation/autumn --limit 1 \
        --json tagName --jq '.[0].tagName')
gh release download "$TAG" \
  --repo autumn-foundation/autumn \
  --pattern 'autumn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz*'
```

### 1.2 Verify its provenance — the one command

```bash
gh attestation verify autumn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
  --repo autumn-foundation/autumn
```

A genuine asset prints a success line naming the workflow that built it:

```
Loaded digest sha256:… for file://autumn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
✓ Verification succeeded!

sha256:… was attested by:
REPO                       PREDICATE_TYPE                  WORKFLOW
autumn-foundation/autumn   https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1  .github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/trunk
```

> **What the source ref means.** The SBOM asset is attested by the Publish
> Gate, which the tag push triggers directly, so its provenance records the tag
> and the tagged commit. The CLI archives are attested by `cli-release.yml`,
> which runs as a child of the `workflow_run`-triggered release workflow — and
> GitHub always runs those in default-branch context, so their recorded ref and
> commit name the default branch even though the build checked the tag out.
> For those assets the subject digest, the repository and the CI run are exact;
> the ref is not. Verify with `--repo`, and do not add `--source-ref
> refs/tags/...` for an archive, which would fail against a genuine asset.

`--repo autumn-foundation/autumn` is **not optional**. Without it, an
attestation from *any* repository would satisfy the check — including one an
attacker published for their own build of their own bytes.

### 1.3 Prove the check is real: tamper with the file

Verification is only worth running if you have seen it fail. Change a single
byte and try again:

```bash
cp autumn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz tampered.tar.gz
printf '\x00' >> tampered.tar.gz

gh attestation verify tampered.tar.gz --repo autumn-foundation/autumn
# ✗ Verification failed: no attestations found for subject sha256:…
```

The attestation is bound to the artifact's **digest**, so any modification — an
extra byte, a repacked tarball with identical contents, a substituted binary —
produces a different digest and finds no attestation.

What this does *not* catch, by design: re-uploading a **genuine, unmodified**
asset somewhere else. The claim is about the bytes and who built them, not about
the filename or which release they hang off. If you need to pin an asset to the
workflow that produced it as well, add:

```bash
gh attestation verify autumn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
  --repo autumn-foundation/autumn \
  --signer-workflow autumn-foundation/autumn/.github/workflows/cli-release.yml
```

### 1.4 Read the release SBOM

Every tagged release attaches `autumn-<tag>.cdx.json`, a CycloneDX 1.5 document
listing every crate in the released workspace:

```bash
gh release download "$TAG" --repo autumn-foundation/autumn \
  --pattern "autumn-${TAG}.cdx.json"

gh attestation verify "autumn-${TAG}.cdx.json" --repo autumn-foundation/autumn

# Which version of `serde` did this release resolve?
jq -r '.components[] | select(.name == "serde") | "\(.name) \(.version)"' \
  "autumn-${TAG}.cdx.json"
```

The SBOM is **deterministic**: it carries no random serial number and no build
timestamp, and its components are sorted. Regenerating it from the tagged
source produces byte-identical output — which is exactly what the release gate
checks (below), so a hand-edited SBOM cannot be published.

---

## Part 2 — verifying a scaffolded app

`autumn release init` generates a Dockerfile that makes all of this the
default. There is nothing to enable.

### 2.1 What's in the image

The image carries its SBOM at a fixed path, advertised as a label so a scanner
can find it knowing nothing about Autumn:

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ index .Config.Labels "io.autumn.sbom.path" }}' my-app:latest
# /usr/share/autumn/sbom.cdx.json

docker run --rm --entrypoint cat my-app:latest /usr/share/autumn/sbom.cdx.json > image-sbom.json
jq '.components | length' image-sbom.json
```

### 2.2 What's in the *binary* — no source tree, no lockfile

The SBOM file above sits *beside* the binary; a file beside a binary can be
swapped. The binary itself independently carries the same list, because the
generated Dockerfile compiles it through [`cargo-auditable`][auditable]
(`RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER=cargo-auditable`), which embeds the resolved
dependency graph into a `.dep-v0` section of the executable.

Read it back with the `autumn` CLI the image already ships:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint autumn my-app:latest \
  sbom --binary /usr/local/bin/my-app
```

This works on any copy of the binary, anywhere — no source tree, no
`Cargo.lock`, no network:

```bash
docker cp "$(docker create my-app:latest)":/usr/local/bin/my-app /tmp/my-app
autumn sbom --binary /tmp/my-app | jq -r '.components[] | "\(.name) \(.version)"' | head
```

If the binary was not built through `cargo-auditable`, the command says so and
names the fix rather than reporting an empty list.

A macOS **universal** binary is refused rather than guessed at: its
architecture slices can carry genuinely different dependency lists (a
`cfg(target_arch)` crate is in one and not another), so describing the whole
file by one of them would omit crates that are really in it. Split it first:

```bash
lipo -thin arm64 my-app -output my-app.arm64
autumn sbom --binary my-app.arm64
```

(Slices that agree are not a disagreement — a universal binary whose slices
carry identical lists is read normally.)

> **If the `autumn` inside the image is older than `sbom`.** The image installs
> the CLI at the version its Dockerfile pins, so an image scaffolded before this
> feature shipped carries a CLI without the subcommand. The binary is still
> auditable — read it with a newer `autumn` on the host (as in the second
> snippet above), or with `cargo audit bin`, which reads the same `.dep-v0`
> section. Regenerating the release files (`autumn release init --force`) with a
> current CLI updates the pin.

### 2.3 Cross-check the two

The sidecar SBOM and the embedded list are produced by different mechanisms
from the same build. They should agree on every runtime crate:

```bash
autumn sbom --binary /tmp/my-app \
  | jq -r '.components[] | select((.properties // []) | any(.name == "cargo:dependency-kind") | not)
           | "\(.name)@\(.version)"' | sort > from-binary.txt

jq -r '.components[] | "\(.name)@\(.version)"' image-sbom.json | sort > from-image.txt

comm -3 from-binary.txt from-image.txt
```

Components that have no crates.io identity — a path dependency, a workspace
member, a `[patch]`ed git checkout — deliberately carry **no** `purl`, and a
`bom-ref` that says what they are (`path:my-app@1.0.0`). A bare
`pkg:cargo/<name>@<version>` asserts a registry package, and emitting one for
an unpublished crate points a scanner at somebody else's project. Git and
alternate-registry dependencies get a `?vcs_url=` / `?repository_url=`
qualifier naming where they actually came from.

The sidecar SBOM is generated from `cargo metadata` and is therefore *broader*:
it covers the whole resolved graph for the image's own target triple and
feature set — minus dev-dependencies, which are resolved but never linked into
the release binary and are therefore excluded from the inventory.

(The image's SBOM is narrowed with `--filter-platform` to the target that built
it — without that, it would list every platform's target-specific dependencies,
the whole `windows-*` family included, none of which can be in a Linux image.
Autumn's **own** release SBOM is deliberately *not* filtered: that is a source
release consumed on every platform, so narrowing it to whichever runner built
it would understate what was published.)
(`--all-features` widens it further, to crates no single build can contain — it
is available deliberately, and deliberately not the default.) The embedded list
is what actually went into the binary. Entries appearing only in
`from-image.txt` are expected only for optional features that were resolved
but not linked into this build; an entry appearing only in `from-binary.txt`
is not, and is worth investigating.

### 2.4 Verify the image's provenance

The scaffolded deploy workflows (`--target aws-ecs`, `gcp-cloud-run`,
`azure-container-apps`) attest every image they push, plus the SBOM baked into
it. Verify by digest:

```bash
IMAGE=registry.example.com/my-app
DIGEST=$(docker buildx imagetools inspect "$IMAGE:v1.2.3" --format '{{ .Manifest.Digest }}')

gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE@$DIGEST" --repo my-org/my-app

# And the SBOM attestation for the same image:
gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE@$DIGEST" \
  --repo my-org/my-app \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
```

(The predicate type follows the SBOM's format. `actions/attest-sbom` maps
CycloneDX to `https://cyclonedx.org/bom`; an SPDX document would instead be
`https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3`.)

Attestations are bound to the image **digest**, never its tag: a tag can be
re-pointed at different bytes later, a digest cannot. Verifying `:v1.2.3` by
tag would tell you about whatever that tag points at *today*.

Deploying with a plain `docker build` — the `fly`, `docker-compose`,
`aws-app-runner` and default targets, none of which scaffold a CI workflow —
still gets you the in-image SBOM and the auditable binary — the
attestation step needs CI, because keyless signing needs a CI identity to sign.
To add it, copy the `Resolve the pushed image digest` /
`Attest build provenance` / `Attest the image SBOM` steps out of one of the
generated deploy workflows into your own, along with the `id-token: write` and
`attestations: write` permissions.

---

## Part 3 — the gates behind all this

You do not have to take the framework's word for any of it either.

**The SBOM matches the tagged source.** `scripts/check-sbom.sh` runs in the
Publish Gate on every tag. It builds the generator from the checkout being
released, generates the SBOM, then regenerates it and compares
component-by-component — which proves the generator is deterministic, the
property everything else here rests on — and requires the root component's
version to equal both `[workspace.package].version` and the pushed tag.

The same `--verify` then runs a **second** time in `prepare-release`, against
the artifact after it has travelled through the artifact store. That is the run
that can catch a substituted or truncated document, and it is the file that run
checks which becomes the release asset. Either way the failure names the
components that drifted:

```console
$ autumn sbom --verify sbom.cdx.json
Error: SBOM does not match the source tree:
  unexpected component: backdoor@6.6.6
  missing component: serde@1.0.228
```

Run the same gate yourself against any checkout:

```bash
./scripts/check-sbom.sh                     # against the working tree
RELEASE_TAG=v0.7.0 ./scripts/check-sbom.sh  # also enforce tag agreement
```

**Downloads during an image build are checksum-verified.** Every artifact the
generated build pulls in, and exactly what each check buys you:

| Download | Integrity |
|---|---|
| `cargo install` of `cargo-chef`, `autumn-cli`, `diesel_cli`, `cargo-auditable` | crates.io checksums, each `--locked` and pinned to an exact `--version` |
| `apt-get install …` | apt repository signatures |
| Tailwind CLI, via `autumn setup` | SHA-256 against the `sha256sums.txt` published with that Tailwind release; refuses to install on a mismatch |
| Base images (`rust:…`, `debian:bookworm-slim`) | tag-pinned, **not** digest-pinned |

There is no unverified `curl` of an executable anywhere in the generated build,
and an integration test enforces that. Two honest caveats: the Tailwind check is
trust-on-first-use against the publisher — it detects a corrupted or truncated
download, not a compromised upstream release that re-published both the binary
and its checksum file — and the base images are pinned by tag, so pin them by
digest yourself if your threat model requires it.

---

## Part 3a — the advisory gate: known-vulnerable dependencies

An SBOM tells you *what* you are running. The advisory gate tells you whether
any of it is known to be vulnerable — and, unlike a dashboard of alerts, it
blocks the build.

### What it checks

Every app `autumn new` generates ships two halves of one gate:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Runs `cargo deny check` on every push and pull request, over the checks `deny.toml` declares. |
| `deny.toml` | The policy it reads: what counts as a failure, and which advisories you have explicitly accepted. |

The check resolves your **whole** dependency graph — transitive crates
included, not just what your `Cargo.toml` names — and matches it against the
[RustSec advisory database][rustsec]. A crate with a known advisory that
`deny.toml` does not waive fails the job. Vulnerabilities always fail;
`unmaintained` and `unsound` advisories fail too (narrow those in `deny.toml`
if you would rather triage them separately), and a yanked crate warns.

Run it locally. CI derives its check list from the sections `deny.toml`
declares, so the exact command depends on your policy — `autumn doctor` does
that derivation for you and reports the same verdict:

```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-deny   # once
autumn doctor                       # derives the checks, as CI does
```

To drive cargo-deny yourself, pass the sections your policy declares. For the
shipped policy, which declares only `[advisories]`, that is:

```bash
cargo deny check advisories
```

Uncomment `[licenses]` and the CI command becomes `cargo deny check advisories
licenses`; a bare `cargo deny check advisories` would then pass locally on a
tree CI rejects.

### Reading a failure

```console
error[vulnerability]: Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels
    ┌─ /home/you/my-app/Cargo.lock:322:1
    │
322 │ rsa 0.9.10 registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index
    │ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    │
    ├ ID: RUSTSEC-2023-0071
    ├ Advisory: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
    ├ Solution: No safe upgrade is available!
    ├ rsa v0.9.10
      └── jsonwebtoken v10.1.0
          └── autumn-web v0.7.0
              └── my-app v0.1.0

advisories FAILED
```

Four things to read, in order:

1. **The id** (`RUSTSEC-2023-0071`) — the advisory's permanent name; the
   `Advisory:` URL has the full write-up and the real-world exploitability.
2. **The crate and version** (`rsa 0.9.10`) — what is actually vulnerable.
3. **`Solution:`** — the fixed version, or "No safe upgrade is available!"
   when upstream has not shipped one.
4. **The dependency path**, read bottom-up — `my-app` → `autumn-web` →
   `jsonwebtoken` → `rsa`. The crate to bump is rarely the vulnerable one; it
   is the highest entry in that chain you control.

Fix it before you waive it: `cargo update -p <crate>` when a patched version is
already compatible, otherwise bump the direct dependency that pulls it in. In an
Autumn app that dependency is usually `autumn-web` itself — most of the tree
arrives through it — so check whether a newer autumn-web release resolves a
fixed version, and if none does yet, [open an
issue](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues) and waive it locally
with a review-by date in the meantime. (The example above is the one advisory
you will not see fail: it ships pre-waived. Every other finding reads the same
way.)

### Waiving an advisory

When there is no fix — or the vulnerable code path is unreachable from your app
— acknowledge the advisory in `deny.toml` instead of weakening the gate:

```toml
[advisories]
ignore = [
    # Why this is acceptable *here*, and when you will look again.
    { id = "RUSTSEC-2023-0071", reason = "no fixed rsa release exists; reaches this app only through jsonwebtoken's RSA-family JWT path; review-by 2026-10-01" },
]
```

A waiver lets exactly one id through. Every other advisory — including a new
one in the same crate — still fails, and the gate itself stays on. The id and
the rationale are committed to your repository, so the decision is reviewable
in a pull request rather than living in someone's memory.

Your generated `deny.toml` ships with a waiver already in it:
`RUSTSEC-2023-0071`. `rsa` reaches every Autumn app through `jsonwebtoken`,
which `autumn-web` depends on unconditionally, and no patched `rsa` release
exists. An app generated with `--bundled-pg` gets a second one
(`RUSTSEC-2024-0384`, `instant`, unmaintained, reachable only through the
embedded-Postgres build stack) — and only that flavor gets it, so cargo-deny's
"this waiver is unused" warning stays available to tell you when one of *your*
waivers has gone stale.

Those waivers are why a freshly scaffolded app's CI is green on day one instead
of red on the first push. Autumn's own CI re-audits autumn-web's dependency tree
against that exact policy on every run, so the shipped waiver set cannot quietly
stop covering what the scaffold ships.

Never disable the gate to get green. `continue-on-error: true`, `|| true`, and
deleting the step all turn a security control into a decoration. Autumn's own
test suite fails if the *generated* workflow does any of them, and in your
project an edited `ci.yml` comes back as a conflict on every
[`autumn upgrade`](upgrading.md#scaffold-files) — the cost of the workaround
keeps being paid. Fix the advisory, or waive it.

### When the advisory database is unreachable

The gate **fails closed**. Fetching the RustSec database is the one part that
needs the network, so the generated workflow does it in its own step: three
attempts, backing off 10s then 20s between them. If the database is still
unreachable the job fails with an explicit message rather than hanging or
silently skipping the audit — a dependency tree nobody could verify is never
reported as clean. The audit itself then runs `--offline` against the database
just fetched, so a failure in *that* step is always a real advisory and never a
network blip.

Two related failures are called out rather than mistaken for an outage:
cargo-deny loads `deny.toml` *before* it touches the network, so a malformed
policy is reported as the configuration error it is; and a missing `deny.toml`
stops the step with a message naming the file, instead of auditing your app
under cargo-deny's built-in default policy, which waives nothing.

### The framework's own gate

Autumn holds itself to the same rule. `scripts/check-advisories.sh` runs in
both PR CI and the **Publish Gate**, so a release cannot be tagged while an
unwaived advisory sits in the tree being published:

```bash
./scripts/check-advisories.sh              # workspace, sqlite, scaffold, fuzz, island-flock graphs
./scripts/check-advisories.sh --self-test  # prove the gate still rejects a CVE
```

Five graphs, because "the dependency tree" means five different things here.
The scaffold graph is the interesting one of the first three: it audits
`autumn-web`'s dependency tree against the `deny.toml` that `autumn new`
writes, with every feature any scaffold flavor can enable turned on — so "your
day-one CI is green" is a checked property of every release rather than a
hope. Being precise about what that covers: it is the autumn-web half of your
tree, audited generously (a superset of what your app compiles from
autumn-web), resolved against Autumn's own lockfile. Your app's own direct
dependencies, and the exact versions your lockfile resolves, are what *your*
CI audits — which is why the gate ships with your app rather than only living
here.

The other two are satellite graphs *inside this repo*, not your app's
concern: `fuzz/` and `examples/island-flock/` are each their own excluded
workspace root with their own `Cargo.lock` (own build reasons — a
nightly/ASAN toolchain and a wasm32-only target, respectively), so nothing in
the three graphs above ever resolves them, and each carries its own narrower
`fuzz/deny.toml` / `examples/island-flock/deny.toml` (advisories + sources
only — see each file's header for why licenses aren't gated there yet). If a
satellite check fails, triage it against that satellite's own `deny.toml`,
not the root one.

`--self-test` is the negative proof, and it runs in Autumn's CI on every pull
request: it audits a throwaway crate carrying a deliberately injected
known-vulnerable dependency (`time 0.1.45`, RUSTSEC-2020-0071) and requires
both policies — Autumn's own and the one shipped into your app — to reject it,
then to accept it once, and only once, that id is waived. A gate nobody has
watched fail is indistinguishable from a gate that no longer runs.

---

## Part 3b — the dev loop

CI is the enforcement point. It is a poor *first* contact with a vulnerable
dependency: by the time the job is red, the change is pushed and the team is
blocked. `autumn doctor` and `autumn dev` move that contact left, without
becoming the kind of audit output developers learn to scroll past.

### One policy file, one waiver store, one auditor

`deny.toml` at the app root is the whole policy surface. It carries the
advisory rules and their waivers, and — commented out in a fresh scaffold —
`[licenses]`, `[bans]` and `[sources]`. `autumn doctor` runs the same auditor
against the same file, with the same waivers and the same check list your CI
job uses. Nothing here is a second implementation, and there is no second
waiver format: a waiver is an `[advisories] ignore` entry, read by doctor, dev
and CI alike.

Two differences remain, and doctor reports both on its own line so you can
judge them:

- **The auditor version.** The generated workflow pins `cargo-deny@0.20.2`; a
  local run uses whatever `cargo deny` is on your PATH. Doctor names the
  version it used. Install the pinned one to remove the difference:
  `cargo install --locked cargo-deny@0.20.2`.
- **The advisory data.** CI fetches the RustSec database immediately before it
  audits, so it always grades against today's advisories. Doctor never fetches
  (see *Offline and air-gapped* below) and names its data age. An advisory
  published since your last fetch is red in CI and silent locally — run
  `cargo deny fetch db` to close the gap.

Uncommenting a section widens both sides at once. The generated workflow
derives its check list from the file:

```bash
checks="advisories"
for section in bans licenses sources; do
  if grep -qE "^[[:space:]]*(\[\[?[[:space:]]*)?[\"']?$section[\"']?[[:space:]]*[].=]" deny.toml; then
    checks="$checks $section"
  fi
done
cargo deny --offline check $checks
```

`autumn doctor` reaches the same answer by parsing the file as TOML, which is
exact where grep can only approximate: `[bans]`, `[ bans ]`, `["bans"]`,
`[bans.build]`, `[[bans.deny]]`, `bans.deny = …` and `bans = { … }` all declare
the same table. The two are held together by a test —
`doctor_and_the_generated_workflow_derive_the_same_checks` runs *this shell* and
`autumn doctor` over every one of those spellings and requires the same answer —
so a rule that drifts fails the build rather than silently un-enforcing your
policy.

### `autumn doctor` — the dependency check

One check, `dependencies`, reporting each finding with its advisory or
violation id, its severity, the crate, and the title:

```text
❌ dependencies — 2 findings, 1 blocking, 1 waived — cargo-deny 0.20.2; checks: advisories; advisory data 3 days old
   RUSTSEC-2099-0001 vulnerability (critical) badcrate 1.2.3 — remote code execution
   RUSTSEC-2023-0071 vulnerability (medium) rsa 0.9.10 — Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels (waived)
   hint: `deny.toml` holds the policy and the waivers; docs/guide/supply-chain.md explains how to fix or waive a finding
```

Blocking findings are listed first. A waived finding is shown as waived and
never fails the check. When nothing is live, the whole check is one line —
including for a freshly scaffolded app, which ships one pre-triaged waiver:

```text
✅ dependencies — no live findings; 1 waived (RUSTSEC-2023-0071) — cargo-deny 0.20.2; checks: advisories; advisory data 0 days old
```

The line follows doctor's ordinary conventions, so
`--json` carries the same detail string, capped at the first ten findings; run
`cargo deny check` itself when you need every one. `--strict` promotes the
check's warnings to exit 1 — stricter than the CI gate, where a cargo-deny
warning is not a failure — so keep `--strict` runs quiet by writing a policy
whose warnings you mean. The scaffold's only warn-level rule is
`yanked = "warn"`; its commented `[bans]` default sets
`multiple-versions = "allow"` for the same reason.

### Severity defaults

Severity is *consequence*, not taxonomy. What your policy denies is graded
high or critical; what it only warns about is graded low or medium:

| Finding | Grade | Doctor |
|---|---|---|
| Vulnerability, CVSS ≥ 9.0 | critical | fail |
| Vulnerability, any lower or absent CVSS | high | fail |
| Unmaintained / unsound (denied by the shipped policy) | high | fail |
| License, ban or source violation | high | fail |
| Yanked crate (`yanked = "warn"`), duplicate crate | low | warn |
| Waived by `[advisories] ignore` | its own CVSS band | pass |

A vulnerability always fails, whatever it scores: cargo-deny denies every
vulnerability and that is not configurable, so grading a CVSS 2.6 vulnerability
"low" would say pass where CI says fail. CVSS is used only to separate critical
from high, which is what the `autumn dev` banner keys on. A **waived** finding
is the one row graded on its own merits rather than on consequence — it has no
consequence left — so the same advisory can read `(medium)` waived and `(high)`
live. The number describes the advisory; the verdict describes the gate.

Critical and high are exactly the findings cargo-deny grades as errors, which
is exactly what makes the CI job red. Reading a doctor failure therefore tells
you which CI failure you are about to get. CVSS v3 base scores come from the
advisory's own vector, computed under the minor version that vector declares —
v3.1 revised the changed-scope impact equation, so the same metrics can score
7.0 under `CVSS:3.0/` and 6.9 under `CVSS:3.1/`, which is a band apart. A
vulnerability with no published score — or one published as a CVSS v4.0 vector,
which is not scored here — is treated as high rather than assumed harmless. Such a finding still fails; it just does not earn the
`autumn dev` banner.

### `autumn dev` — quiet by default

`autumn dev` never blocks startup and never interrupts the rebuild loop over a
dependency finding. Output is rationed:

- **Clean or fully waived tree** — nothing. Zero dependency lines.
- **Findings the policy only warns about** — nothing. A duplicate crate or a
  yanked crate leaves CI green, so it is doctor's to report, not dev's.
- **Findings the policy denies, below critical** — one line: the count and the
  worst severity.
- **A critical advisory** — a startup banner, in the style of the
  maintenance-mode warning, naming the ids.
- **Policy not evaluated** — nothing. Silence is dev's answer to a missing
  auditor, a missing database, or a missing policy file; `autumn doctor` is
  where those are reported.

Nothing waits on the audit. It starts *after* the initial `cargo build` — run
beside the build, its `cargo metadata` contends with Cargo's package-cache lock
and slows the build itself — and the watch loop then polls for the result
without blocking, printing it the moment it lands. A verdict that has not
arrived within thirty seconds is dropped. So the audit costs the dev loop no
latency at all, on a cold start or a rebuild; the trade is that the line can
appear a second or two after the server does.

### Offline and air-gapped

Neither command ever fetches. Both run `cargo deny --offline` against whatever
RustSec data is already on disk, so neither can hang on the network and neither
depends on it.

- **Database never fetched** — `autumn doctor` **passes**, with a detail that
  reads `not evaluated` and hints `cargo deny fetch db`. Same reasoning as a
  missing auditor below: no Autumn install path fetches the database, so
  warning here would make `autumn doctor --strict` red on every machine that
  has not opted in. It never reports a clean tree it could not verify — but do
  not rely on `--strict` to notice an unevaluated tree; read the detail.
- **Database present** — doctor reports its age (`advisory data 3 days old`),
  measured from the last fetch. Data older than 7 days is marked **stale** and
  warns, even on a tree with no findings: CI audits against a database it
  fetches every run, so a verdict is only as fresh as the data behind it.
- **cargo-deny not installed** — doctor **passes**, and its detail reads
  `not evaluated`, with the install command and the checks it would have run.
  It is not a warning: `--strict` turns warnings into exit 1, and cargo-deny is
  not installed by any Autumn install path, so warning here would make
  `autumn doctor --strict` red on every machine that has not opted in. A pass
  that says "not evaluated" is never a silent pass.
- **The audit produced no verdict** — a warning naming the reason. This covers
  a `deny.toml` that is not valid TOML (cargo-deny loads the policy before it
  audits, so the CI gate fails outright on one), a section written in a
  spelling only one of the two derivations can see, and cargo-deny rejecting
  the tree for a reason the diagnostic parse could not account for. All three
  are reported *before* the missing-tool checks above: those pass, and a pass
  on a repository CI rejects is the one outcome this check exists to prevent.
- **`autumn dev`** — silent in every one of those states.

Refresh the data with one command, network permitting:

```bash
cargo deny fetch db
```

On an air-gapped machine, set `[advisories] db-path` in `deny.toml` to a
directory *holding* database checkouts — the same shape as
`~/.cargo/advisory-dbs`, not a checkout itself — and mirror the RustSec
repository into it. `~` and `$CARGO_HOME` are expanded, as cargo-deny expands
them. Doctor reads that path and ages it the same way.

| `autumn sbom --binary FILE` | What is compiled into this binary? (no source tree) |
| `autumn sbom --features F` | …resolving the features the build used. |
| `autumn sbom --no-default-features` | …with the `default` feature disabled (slimmed builds). |
| `autumn sbom --filter-platform T` | …restricted to one target triple. |

| `autumn doctor --json` | …as machine-readable output, ids and severities included. |
| `cargo deny fetch db` | Refresh the RustSec advisory database doctor reads. |
| `cargo deny check advisories` | Is anything in this tree known-vulnerable? (reads `deny.toml`) |
| `./scripts/check-advisories.sh` | …for Autumn's own graphs, and for the app scaffold's. |
| `./scripts/check-advisories.sh --self-test` | Can that gate still reject a known CVE? |
| `gh attestation verify F --repo O/R` | Did `O/R`'s CI build exactly these bytes? |
