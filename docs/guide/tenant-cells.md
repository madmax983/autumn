# Per-Tenant Memory Cells

Row-level tenancy scopes a tenant's *rows*; per-tenant memory cells account for
a tenant's supported *cooperative tracked scratch memory*. They do **not** bound
arbitrary in-process memory. On top of the existing tenancy story, each
resolved tenant gets a `TenantCell` — a byte-accounting boundary with a soft
quota and an owned scratch buffer — created lazily on the first request that
touches tenant memory. Allocations that flow through the cell are tracked
against the tenant's quota; when the cell is evicted and dropped, Rust's
ownership rules deterministically reclaim its tracked footprint.

This is orthogonal to sharding. Sharding decides *which database* a tenant's
rows live on; cells decide how much memory allocated through the supported
arena API a single tenant may retain before its own requests start failing.

The whole cell is pure, safe Rust: it holds under the workspace-wide
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. It is an accounting cell, not a bounding allocator —
see [The accounting guarantee](#the-accounting-guarantee) for exactly what that
buys you.

## Configuration

```toml
[tenancy]
enabled = true
quota_bytes = 1048576   # 1 MiB soft quota per tenant; 0 (the default) disables the quota
max_cells = 10000       # cap resident tenant cells; LRU-evict above this. 0 (the default) = unbounded
idle_ttl_secs = 3600    # evict a cell idle longer than this many seconds. 0 (the default) = disabled
```

`quota_bytes` is the soft per-tenant quota applied to every cell the registry
mints. `0` — the default — disables the quota entirely: charges always succeed
and nothing is capped, while `tracked_bytes()` still accounts what flows
through the cell.

`max_cells` bounds how many tenant cells stay resident in the registry. When a
new cell would push the map past this count, the least-recently-used cells are
evicted until it fits. `0` — the default — leaves the registry unbounded. This
matters whenever tenant IDs are high-cardinality or request-controlled: a
tenant sourced from a header, JWT claim, or subdomain lets callers mint new IDs
at will, and on an allocating route every distinct ID would otherwise grow the
registry without bound. `max_cells` caps that growth to a fixed working set.

`idle_ttl_secs` evicts a cell whose last access is older than this many seconds.
`0` — the default — disables the idle sweep. Enforcement is lazy: the TTL is
applied on cell insert rather than by a background timer (a reusable
`evict_idle_older_than` primitive is also exposed for callers that want to run a
sweep on their own cadence).

Both limits reclaim memory the same way manual `evict` does — see
[Eviction and lifecycle](#eviction-and-lifecycle).

`AUTUMN_TENANCY__*`, so every field above can be supplied without an
`autumn.toml`.

## Using the cell in a handler

Reach for the current request's cell with `current_tenant_cell()`. It returns
`Some(Arc<TenantCell>)` when tenancy is enabled and a tenant is bound to the
request, and `None` otherwise (so a route that runs outside a tenant context
degrades gracefully). Calling it is what *materializes* the cell for the
request — routes that never call it create no cell.

Prefer `current_tenant_arena()` and its typed, fallible `try_bytes` and
`try_string` APIs. The returned value owns both its allocation and quota charge,
so supported request scratch state cannot separate the two:

```rust
let arena = autumn_web::tenant_cell::current_tenant_arena()
    .ok_or_else(|| AutumnError::service_unavailable_msg("tenant arena unavailable"))?;
let mut scratch = arena.try_bytes(512 * 1024)?;
scratch.as_mut_slice()[0] = 1;
```

`try_charge(n)` is a lower-level compatibility API. It reserves `n` bytes
against the quota and hands back a `Charge` RAII guard. The bytes stay tracked
for exactly as long as you hold the guard:
drop it (or let it fall off the end of the handler) and they are released
immediately. If the charge would exceed the quota it returns `QuotaExceeded`,
which converts into `AutumnError` as an HTTP **503 Service Unavailable** — so a
handler returning `AutumnResult` can just use `?`:

```rust
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use autumn_web::tenant_cell::current_tenant_cell;

#[post("/reports")]
async fn build_report() -> AutumnResult<String> {
    // Account for a large working buffer we are about to build for this tenant.
    // Over-quota tenants get a 503 here via `?`; everyone else proceeds.
    let _charge = match current_tenant_cell() {
        Some(cell) => Some(cell.try_charge(512 * 1024)?),
        None => None, // tenancy disabled / no tenant bound: nothing to account
    };

    let report = expensive_render().await?;
    Ok(report)
    // `_charge` drops here, releasing the 512 KiB back to the cell and the
    // process-wide gauge.
}
```

The cell also owns a per-tenant **scratch buffer** — a keyed byte store whose
contents count against the same quota. Use it for state you want to keep
resident across a request (or hand between request phases) while staying
honest about its cost:

```rust
use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use autumn_web::tenant_cell::current_tenant_cell;

#[post("/session/scratch")]
async fn stash() -> AutumnResult<&'static str> {
    if let Some(cell) = current_tenant_cell() {
        // Charged: key capacity + value capacity + a fixed per-entry overhead.
        // Returns 503 (via `?`) if it would push the tenant over quota.
        cell.scratch_insert("draft", b"partial work".to_vec())?;

        if let Some(bytes) = cell.scratch_get("draft") {
            // ... use the stored bytes ...
            let _ = bytes;
        }

        // Removing frees only the key + value capacity back to the quota; the
        // fixed per-entry overhead is retained (against the entry high-water
        // mark) until the accounting domain is no longer resident and its last
        // request/eviction handle drops.
        let _ = cell.scratch_remove("draft");
    }
    Ok("ok")
}
```

## Cooperative quota accounting (not hard isolation)

A tracked quota breach is scoped to the tenant that hit it. When a tenant is over
quota, only *its* over-budget request fails — with a 503 — and every other
tenant has its own independent counter. This is counter independence, not a
claim that shared-process allocator pressure cannot affect other traffic.

Where in the request that 503 lands depends on the API. `try_charge(n)?`
reserves *before* you allocate: the quota is checked up front, so an over-quota
tenant is rejected without ever building the buffer. `scratch_insert(key,
value)` instead takes an already-built `Vec`, so the value exists in memory
before the check — the quota rejects it before it is stored in and counted
against the cell, bounding what the cell *retains*, but it does not prevent the
caller's transient allocation. That is the same tracked-bytes, not-RSS boundary
as [The accounting guarantee](#the-accounting-guarantee) below: the cell bounds
the memory it owns, not every byte a handler touches on the way there.

## Eviction and lifecycle

Cells live in a process-wide `TenantCellRegistry` shared by every clone of the
app state. Three properties matter operationally:

- **Lazy creation.** Binding a request to a tenant does not allocate a cell;
  the first call to `current_tenant_cell()` (internally a registry
  `get_or_create`) materializes it. Routes that never touch tenant memory leave
  the registry untouched.
- **Residency eviction with deferred teardown.**
  `TenantCellRegistry::evict(tenant_id)` removes the tenant's cell from the
  resident cache and returns it. Eviction does not create permission for a
  second accounting domain: while the returned handle, an outstanding request,
  or a live `Charge` still owns the old domain, a subsequent `get_or_create` for
  that tenant resurrects the same quota counter and scratch map and makes it
  resident again. The scratch contents therefore remain visible to that
  subsequent request, and its charges aggregate with the earlier request's
  charges under one tenant quota.

  Teardown occurs only after the domain is no longer resident and its final
  strong owner drops. At that point the scratch buffer is reclaimed and its
  tracked bytes leave the process-wide gauge through ordinary Rust `Drop`, not
  a background reclamation task. If an operator needs to purge a tenant's
  scratch state, traffic for that tenant must first quiesce; then call `evict`
  and drop its returned handle after all outstanding request/charge handles have
  completed. A request arriving before teardown prevents the purge by
  resurrecting and re-residenting the existing domain.
- **Automatic eviction.** With `max_cells` or `idle_ttl_secs` set (see
  [Configuration](#configuration)), the registry evicts on its own — LRU cells
  above the cap, and cells idle past the TTL — enforced lazily on cell insert.
  Automatic eviction has the same residency-versus-lifecycle semantics as
  manual `evict`: it drops only the resident-cache reference, so an in-flight
  holder is never disturbed and a same-tenant request arriving before teardown
  reuses and re-residents the domain.

Eviction is safe to do mid-request. Each in-flight request caches the cell it
first materialized, so eviction does **not** reset that request's state. It also
does not hand a subsequent request a fresh empty cell while the old domain is
alive: both requests share its scratch state and aggregate quota. `len()` and
`is_empty()` report resident-cache membership, `accounting_domain_count()` also
includes evicted domains retained by in-flight work (plus dead tombstones
awaiting bounded incremental cleanup), and `total_tracked_bytes()` covers every
live domain regardless of residency.

### Resident-cell structural overhead

`total_tracked_bytes()` is **API-accounted tenant payload**, not the cost of
the accounting machinery itself. An empty cell therefore reports zero tracked
bytes while still occupying process memory. `TenantCellRegistry::structural_overhead()`
reports that second quantity separately. The density smoke test creates 1,000
empty cells with fixed-width `tenant-NNNN` ids, verifies the configured
1,000-cell resident target, prints total and per-cell structure, then evicts
every entry.

The lower-bound estimate sums the current platform's `size_of` layouts for `TenantCell` and
`TenantCellInner` (including atomics, the scratch-map header, and mutex), both
per-cell `Arc` counter headers, occupied registry entries plus every lifecycle
record (resident, evicted-but-live, or awaiting the tombstone sweep), the
tenant-id allocation capacities (each resident cell's registry key and own id,
and every lifecycle key), and amortized spare buckets plus control bytes for
both the registry and the lifecycle map.
Because `HashMap::capacity()` is an **element capacity**, not a bucket count,
the model rounds it up to the current SwissTable implementation's power-of-two
backing bucket count. For this workload that means 1,792 elements map to 2,048
buckets, including the load-factor-reserved slots. The registry retains that
bucket estimate as a high-water mark for each map: removals (and lifecycle
tombstone sweeps) can consume tombstones and lower the map's reported element
capacity without shrinking its backing allocation, so recomputing solely from
the current capacity would undercount churned registries.
It also reports the one-off registry allocation separately. On 64-bit Linux,
the 1,000-cell smoke test currently measures **336 lower-bound structural bytes
per cell** plus a **304-byte one-off registry structure** (336,472 bytes total);
run the
following command to reproduce the exact number for a toolchain/platform:

```sh
cargo test -p autumn-web --test integration_tests \
  integration::tenant_cell_unit::density_smoke_thousand_cells -- --exact --nocapture
```

This is a deterministic **structural lower bound**, not RSS. Rust does not expose
allocator allocation headers, size-class rounding, internal fragmentation, or
page residency portably, so those are explicitly excluded. The registry bucket
element capacity is observed exactly; the backing bucket conversion and
one-control-byte-per-bucket component model the current SwissTable
implementation. Its trailing control group and allocation padding are excluded,
as are allocator details, so the result is deliberately labeled a lower bound.
The ordinary CI test never asserts RSS; an RSS
sample would only be an observational, allocator- and environment-dependent
metric.

**Dynamic quota.** A cell's `quota_bytes` is stored atomically rather than
frozen at creation. Every access refreshes a resident cell's quota from the
configured `quota_bytes`, so a future config-reload path could change the
per-tenant quota without evicting and rebuilding cells. No such reload path
exists today — the mechanism is in place for when one lands, and until then the
refresh simply re-applies the same configured value.

## The accounting guarantee

`tracked_bytes()` is a deterministic accounting of the allocations made
*through* the cell, and it covers exactly three things:

- each live `Charge`'s declared bytes,
- the allocation **capacity** of every stored scratch key `String` and value
  `Vec<u8>` (capacity, not length — a `Vec` with large spare capacity is
  charged for what it keeps resident), and
- a fixed per-entry overhead, exposed as
  `TenantCell::scratch_entry_overhead()`, charged against the **high-water mark**
  of live scratch entries (not the current count), so that a tenant storing many
  tiny entries cannot amplify its footprint past the cap via map growth. Because
  a `HashMap` never shrinks its bucket array on removal, this overhead is
  *retained* after a `scratch_remove` (which frees only the removed key and value
  capacity) and is reclaimed only when the evicted accounting domain's final
  owner drops. So `tracked_bytes()` can stay elevated after you insert then
  remove scratch entries, and re-inserting within the prior peak adds no new
  overhead (churn-safe).

Everything tracked, including every arena allocation, is deterministically
reclaimed when a non-resident accounting domain's final owner drops. The precise
lifecycle and boundary are recorded in
[ADR 0012](../adr/0012-cooperative-tenant-memory-boundary.md). What it is
**not**: a measurement of the tenant's true process RSS.
Allocator-internal fragmentation, size-class rounding, and any allocation a
handler makes *outside* the cell's API (a bare `Box::new`, a `Vec` you build
and never charge) are invisible to the counter by design. Charge through the
arena for supported scratch memory you want bounded; the guarantee is that
those tracked bytes are counted honestly and released deterministically.

## Limitations and roadmap

- **No hard memory isolation** — bare `Vec`, `String`, `Box`, collections,
  request/response bodies, futures, stacks, database/TLS/plugin allocations,
  allocator metadata, fragmentation, and native allocations are outside the
  boundary. Use a process/container/VM when adversarial hard isolation is
  required. `try_charge` is cooperative accounting, not allocation ownership.

- **Config hot-reload** — resident cells already refresh their quota from
  `quota_bytes` on every access (see [Dynamic quota](#eviction-and-lifecycle)),
  but nothing re-reads `autumn.toml` at runtime to feed a new value, so the
  quota is effectively fixed for a process's lifetime. Wiring up a reload path
  is the remaining half of
  [#1783](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues/1783).
