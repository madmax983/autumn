# TLS & HTTPS

This guide covers serving your Autumn app over HTTPS. There are three ways to do
it, and which one you want depends on where TLS is terminated:

- **Direct in-process TLS** — the app terminates HTTPS itself on its own
  host:port using a certificate and key you supply. Best for a **single host
  where you already have a certificate** (from `certbot`, a corporate CA, or a
  cloud cert vendor).
- **Automatic ACME (Let's Encrypt)** — the app obtains and renews its own
  certificate over HTTP-01, with no static cert on disk and no proxy. Best for a
  **single host that should get and keep a valid public certificate
  automatically**.
- **Reverse-proxy / platform termination** — TLS is terminated in front of the
  app (kamal-proxy, nginx, a cloud load balancer) and the app serves plain HTTP
  behind it. Best for the **managed `autumn deploy` flow and multi-replica
  deployments**, and still the recommendation when a proxy already fronts your
  fleet.

> **Quick decision.** Own cert, single host → [Direct TLS](#direct-in-process-tls-servertls).
> Want auto-issued certs, single host, no proxy →
> [ACME](#automatic-acme-certificates-servertlsacme). Tenants bringing their own
> hostnames → [Tenant custom domains](#tenant-custom-domains-servertlsacmecustom_domains).
> Using `autumn deploy`, a proxy, or multiple replicas →
> [Reverse-proxy termination](#terminating-tls-at-a-reverse-proxy).

Whichever way the *server's* certificate is provisioned, you can additionally
verify the *client's* — see
[Mutual TLS](#mutual-tls-verifying-client-certificates-servertlsclient_auth).

Direct TLS and ACME are both **off by default** and each gated behind an
off-by-default cargo feature (`tls` and `acme`), so a default build never links
the TLS stack. The reverse-proxy path needs neither feature — the app just
serves HTTP.

---

## Direct in-process TLS (`[server.tls]`)

With the `tls` cargo feature enabled and a `[server.tls]` section configured,
the app terminates HTTPS itself on the same host:port — no sidecar proxy.

Enable the feature in your app's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[features]
tls = ["autumn-web/tls"]
```

Then point the app at your PEM certificate and key:

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 443

[server.tls]
cert_path = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/fullchain.pem"
key_path = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/privkey.pem"
# reload_interval_secs = 60      # certs hot-reload by polling file mtimes (default)
# handshake_timeout_secs = 10    # TLS handshake timeout (default)
```

The `[features]` block above only *defines* the forwarding feature — because
`tls` is off by default you must also build/run **with it enabled**, otherwise
the TLS stack is never linked:

- `cargo run --features tls` (or `cargo build --release --features tls`) — uses
  the `tls = ["autumn-web/tls"]` forwarding feature declared above.
- Or turn it on directly without the forwarding feature:
  `cargo run --features autumn-web/tls`.
- For a CLI-built single binary: `autumn build --embed --features tls` — the
  `--features` flag is forwarded to cargo through every build phase.

**Configuring `[server.tls]` without the `tls` feature compiled in is a
fail-fast boot error, not a silent fallback.** `AppBuilder::run` validates the
wiring before binding anything and exits non-zero with:

> `[server.tls] is configured but this binary was built without the `tls`
> feature; rebuild with `--features tls`, or remove [server.tls] to serve plain
> HTTP`

so a build that forgot the feature can never quietly serve plain HTTP on a port
you expect to be HTTPS.

Fields:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cert_path` | required | PEM certificate chain (leaf first, then intermediates). |
| `key_path` | required | PEM private key for the leaf. |
| `reload_interval_secs` | `60` | How often the cert/key file mtimes are polled for a hot reload. |
| `handshake_timeout_secs` | `10` | Maximum time allowed for a TLS handshake. |

Once it is running you should get a valid HTTPS response with no proxy in front:

```bash
curl https://app.example.com/health   # -> {"status":"ok", ...}
```

### Fail-fast startup validation

The certificate is validated at startup, so a broken cert stops the boot instead
of silently serving an unusable listener. Startup fails fast on:

- a missing or unreadable `cert_path` / `key_path` file,
- an unparseable or empty PEM,
- a private key that does not match the certificate leaf,
- an expired or not-yet-valid leaf or intermediate.

### Hot reload (renewals without a restart)

The app polls the cert and key file mtimes every `reload_interval_secs` (default
60s) and swaps in the new material when either file changes. A certificate
renewal — from `certbot`, an ACME client, or any tool that rewrites the PEM
files in place — is picked up **without a restart and without dropping the
site**.

### The `autumn doctor` TLS check

`autumn doctor` gains a `tls` check that inspects the configured certificate: it
**fails** on a missing, invalid, or expired certificate and **warns** when the
leaf expires within 30 days — so an approaching expiry surfaces in CI or a
pre-deploy check rather than at the moment the cert lapses.

### What behaves the same under TLS

Turning on `[server.tls]` changes the transport, not the app. The framework
probes (`/health`, `/live`, `/ready`, `/startup`), `/actuator/health`, the
inbound request timeout (`[server.timeouts]`), SSE streams, `wss://` WebSockets,
and graceful shutdown of an in-flight request all behave exactly as they do over
plain HTTP — including that an SSE body still streams incrementally rather than
being buffered, and that a stream is still exempt from the request deadline.

That parity is enforced, not asserted: `autumn/tests/integration/tls_app_surface.rs`
serves the *same* router twice — once over the TLS listener, once over plain TCP
— and requires each probe response to match on status, body, and content type;
it also drives a `wss://` echo, an SSE stream, a timed-out handler, and a
shutdown drain over TLS on every CI run.

Two things do differ, both by construction:

- **`[server.tls]` cannot be combined with `server.unix_socket`.** Direct TLS
  terminates on `host:port`; configuring both is a startup error.
- **In-place upgrades (`SIGUSR2` handoff) do not apply to a TLS build.** A
  handoff passes the listening socket to a successor process, and a successor
  that terminates TLS cannot adopt a plaintext listener whose clients are
  mid-connection. So a TLS build never offers its socket for handoff (the signal
  logs `in-place upgrade refused` and the running app carries on), and a TLS
  build handed an inherited socket exits at startup rather than failing every
  connection. Restart the process to deploy a new build.

### Serving HTTPS from the release image

`autumn release init` generates a Dockerfile whose builder runs a bare
`cargo build --release` (or `autumn build --embed` with `--embed`). Neither
passes `--features`, so the `tls` feature has to be a **default** feature of
your app for the image to link the TLS stack:

```toml
[features]
default = ["flash", "tls"]
tls = ["autumn-web/tls"]
```

Mount the certificate and key into the container and point `[server.tls]` at
them with the environment (no `autumn.toml` edit needed — the runtime
materializes the section from these vars), and re-point the image's own
HEALTHCHECK at `https://`:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:ro \
  -e AUTUMN_SERVER__TLS__CERT_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/fullchain.pem \
  -e AUTUMN_SERVER__TLS__KEY_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/privkey.pem \
  -e AUTUMN_HEALTHCHECK_URL=https://localhost:3000/health \
  -e AUTUMN_HEALTHCHECK_INSECURE=1 \
  -p 443:3000 \
  my-app
```

**Mount the whole `/etc/letsencrypt` tree, at the same path**, not just the
`live/<domain>` directory. certbot's `live/*.pem` are *relative symlinks* into
`../../archive/<domain>/`, so a bind mount of `live/<domain>` alone leaves every
target outside the mount: the container resolves them under `/etc/archive`,
finds nothing, and the app fails fast on an unreadable certificate instead of
serving HTTPS. Mounting the tree at the identical path keeps the symlinks valid
and lets a renewal — which writes a new `archive/` file and re-points the
symlink — be picked up by the poller, since the mtime it stats is the
symlink's target.

With a certificate that is *not* symlinked (a corporate or vendor PEM), any
directory works:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /srv/tls:/etc/autumn/tls:ro \
  -e AUTUMN_SERVER__TLS__CERT_PATH=/etc/autumn/tls/fullchain.pem \
  -e AUTUMN_SERVER__TLS__KEY_PATH=/etc/autumn/tls/privkey.pem \
  -e AUTUMN_HEALTHCHECK_URL=https://localhost:3000/health \
  -e AUTUMN_HEALTHCHECK_INSECURE=1 \
  -p 443:3000 \
  my-app
```

Both health-check variables matter. `AUTUMN_HEALTHCHECK_URL` re-points the
generated `HEALTHCHECK`, which defaults to `http://localhost:3000/health`: a
plain-HTTP probe against an HTTPS listener marks the container **unhealthy**
forever — and in the generated `docker-compose.yml`, anything waiting on
`condition: service_healthy` then never starts.

`AUTUMN_HEALTHCHECK_INSECURE=1` lets that probe skip certificate verification.
It is needed because the probe is a loopback call to the container's own
listener while your certificate is issued to the app's *public* hostname, so it
can never validate as `localhost`. Set it only with a loopback URL — it applies
to whatever URL you configure, and unset (the default) the probe always
verifies. The opt-in is deliberate rather than inferred from the URL: `user@`,
`#fragment`, and lookalike hostnames all make a URL *read* as loopback while
curl resolves it somewhere else, so a scheme/host parser in the probe would
quietly stop verifying certificates for a remote endpoint.

Mount the key read-only and keep it `0600` on the host, owned by a user the
container's `autumn` user (uid 10001) can read. (certbot's `archive/` is
`0700 root` by default, so either run the container as a user that can read it
or relax the group permission for the app's user — a certificate the app cannot
open is a fail-fast boot error naming the path, not a silent fallback.) Because
the certificate lives on a bind mount, a host-side `certbot renew` rewrites the
files the container polls — the hot reload works exactly as it does outside a
container, with no image rebuild and no restart.

CI exercises this path on every change to the deployment scaffold: the
`https-target` job in `.github/workflows/release-image-boot.yml` builds the
generated image with `tls` on, boots it with a self-signed test certificate,
and requires an HTTPS `/health` + `/actuator/health` 200 (validated with
`--cacert`), that plain HTTP on the same port does *not* answer, and that the
container's own HEALTHCHECK reaches `healthy`.

### Renewing with certbot

`certbot` pairs cleanly with direct TLS because it writes renewed certificates
back to the same paths, and the hot-reload picks them up.

1. Obtain a certificate. The standalone authenticator answers the HTTP-01
   challenge on port 80, so run it while nothing else holds that port:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d app.example.com
   ```

   certbot writes the live certificate to
   `/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/fullchain.pem` and the key to
   `.../privkey.pem` — exactly the paths used in the `[server.tls]` sample above.

2. Renewal is automatic. certbot installs a systemd timer (or cron job) that runs
   `certbot renew` twice daily and rewrites `fullchain.pem` / `privkey.pem` in
   place when a certificate is within its renewal window. Because the app polls
   the file mtimes, the renewed certificate is served on the next poll with **no
   restart and no dropped requests** — you do not need a `--deploy-hook` to
   reload the app.

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run   # verify the renewal path works
   ```

If you would rather not run certbot at all, the app can obtain and renew its own
certificate — see [Automatic ACME certificates](#automatic-acme-certificates-servertlsacme)
below.

### Local development certificates (mkcert)

For `https://localhost` in development, [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
generates a certificate signed by a locally-trusted CA, so your browser accepts
it without warnings.

1. Install the local CA once (adds it to your system/browser trust store):

   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   ```

2. Generate a certificate for your dev hostnames:

   ```bash
   mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
   # writes ./localhost+2.pem and ./localhost+2-key.pem
   ```

3. Point a dev config (or a `[profile.dev]` override) at the generated files:

   ```toml
   [server.tls]
   cert_path = "localhost+2.pem"
   key_path = "localhost+2-key.pem"
   ```

You can now load `https://localhost:<port>` with a trusted certificate. Keep the
generated `*.pem` files out of version control — they are per-developer and the
key is a secret.

---

## Automatic ACME certificates (`[server.tls.acme]`)

With the `acme` cargo feature, the app provisions and renews its own TLS
certificate from an ACME certificate authority (Let's Encrypt by default) over
the HTTP-01 challenge — no static certificate on disk and no reverse proxy. It
builds on the `tls` listener: the issued certificate hot-swaps into the same
reloadable resolver `[server.tls]` uses.

Enable the feature:

```toml
[features]
acme = ["autumn-web/acme"]
```

The happy path is ≤10 lines of config:

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 443

[server.tls.acme]
domains = ["app.example.com"]
contact_email = "admin@example.com"
directory = "production"          # omit for Let's Encrypt STAGING (see below)
```

As with the `tls` feature, ACME is off by default, so build and run **with the
`acme` feature enabled** (it turns on `tls` transitively):

- `cargo run --features acme` — uses the `acme = ["autumn-web/acme"]` forwarding
  feature declared above (or `cargo run --features autumn-web/acme` without it).
- `autumn build --embed --features acme` for a CLI-built single binary.

**Configuring `[server.tls.acme]` without the `acme` feature compiled in is a
fail-fast boot error**, exactly like the `tls` guard above — `AppBuilder::run`
exits non-zero with:

> `[server.tls.acme] is configured but this binary was built without the `acme`
> feature; rebuild with `--features acme`, or configure a static
> cert_path/key_path instead`

On first boot the app answers the ACME HTTP-01 challenge on `http_challenge_port`
(default `80`), obtains a certificate for `domains`, and starts serving HTTPS.
That same `:80` listener also **redirects plain HTTP to HTTPS**, so visitors who
hit `http://` are upgraded automatically.

Fields:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `domains` | required | One or more non-wildcard domains to issue for. Each entry is used **verbatim** as the certificate's SAN and as the ACME order's DNS identifier, so an entry with leading or trailing whitespace is rejected at startup rather than requested as-is. |
| `contact_email` | required | Contact address registered with the ACME account. |
| `directory` | Let's Encrypt **staging** | ACME directory. Built-in endpoints are the bare strings `"staging"` (default) and `"production"`. A private CA / Pebble uses the inline table `{ custom = { url = "https://your-ca.example/dir" } }` — a bare URL string is **not** accepted (see below). |
| `cache_dir` | `config/acme` | Where the account key and issued certificate are cached. |
| `http_challenge_port` | `80` | Port the HTTP-01 challenge (and HTTP→HTTPS redirect) listens on. |
| `renew_before_days` | `30` | Renew this many days before expiry (a whole number, unquoted, and `< 90`). |
| `ca_root_path` | unset | PEM root that signs the **ACME directory's own HTTPS certificate**. Only needed for a private CA / Pebble; see below. |

> **Staging is the default — switch to production deliberately.** When
> `directory` is unset the app uses the **Let's Encrypt staging** environment,
> which issues certificates from an untrusted test CA (browsers will warn) but
> has **very generous rate limits**. Staging-first is intentional: Let's
> Encrypt's production environment enforces strict issuance rate limits, and a
> misconfiguration loop (wrong domain, port 80 unreachable, DNS not pointed yet)
> can burn your production quota for a week. Validate end-to-end against staging,
> confirm the challenge succeeds, then set `directory = "production"` to get a
> publicly-trusted certificate. The `renew_before_days` window (default 30) keeps
> renewals well ahead of the 90-day certificate lifetime so a transient failure
> has many days of retries before anything expires.

> **Pointing at a private CA (e.g. Pebble).** `directory` is an enum: the
> built-in endpoints are the bare strings `directory = "staging"` and

> ```
>
> A bare URL string (`directory = "https://pebble.test/dir"`) is **not** a valid

> contact_email = "admin@example.com"
> directory = { custom = { url = "https://pebble.test/dir" } }
> ca_root_path = "config/pebble-root.pem"
> ```
>
> `ca_root_path` replaces the client's trust anchors *for the ACME control plane
> only* — it has no bearing on which certificates browsers accept from your site.
> `autumn doctor` grades it (`acme_ca_root`) and **fails** on a path that is
> missing or holds no certificate, since that state can only ever produce failed
> orders.

### How issuance and renewal work

- **Provisioning** is over HTTP-01: the `:80` listener serves the challenge
  token, the CA validates it, and the issued certificate is cached under
  `cache_dir` (default `config/acme`) and swapped into the live resolver.
- **Renewal** runs on a coordinator loop that wakes hourly and renews any
  certificate within `renew_before_days` of expiry; the refreshed certificate
  hot-swaps into the live resolver with no restart. Leader election only
  serializes **which** instance orders a certificate — it does **not** make ACME
  fleet-safe (see the caveat below).
- **Mutual exclusion.** ACME and static `cert_path` / `key_path` are mutually
  exclusive — configure exactly one. Set `[server.tls.acme]` to auto-issue, or
  `[server.tls]` with `cert_path` / `key_path` to serve your own certificate.

> **Single-process / single-host only.** This in-process ACME flow keeps the
> HTTP-01 challenge token map in the process and the issued certificate in a
> local on-disk cache (`cache_dir`). Behind a load balancer, or with more than
> one replica, the CA's `:80` challenge can be routed to a replica that lacks the
> token (issuance and renewal 404), and non-leader replicas cannot adopt a
> certificate renewed on another instance from that non-shared store. Leader
> election only decides **which** instance orders a certificate; it does not make
> multi-replica ACME work — the app logs a loud startup warning when a
> distributed scheduler backend is configured. For multi-replica or clustered
> deployments, terminate TLS at a shared reverse proxy / load balancer, or use a
> single dedicated TLS-terminating instance.
>
> [DNS-01](#wildcard-certificates-via-dns-01-servertlsacmedns) removes **half**
> of this: its challenge record lives in your zone rather than in one replica's
> memory, so the `:80` routing problem goes away and the CA never connects to
> your host at all. It does not distribute certificates. The store is still
> local disk, so replicas that did not win the renewal lease never receive the
> issued certificate and keep serving the self-signed placeholder — the startup
> warning still fires under DNS-01, naming the certificate store. To run ACME
> across replicas at all, `cache_dir` must be on storage every replica shares.

### Scope

HTTP-01 as described above is a **single-host** path: the challenge token lives
in the process, so behind a load balancer the CA's `:80` probe can land on a
replica that never published it. For a wildcard certificate — or for a
multi-replica deployment — use **DNS-01**, next.

---

## Wildcard certificates via DNS-01 (`[server.tls.acme.dns]`)

If you run subdomain-per-tenant (`tenant1.myapp.com`, `tenant2.myapp.com`, …),
HTTP-01 is the wrong shape: it needs one issuance per hostname, so tenant *N*'s
first request waits on a certificate order, and Let's Encrypt's rate limits
become a ceiling on how fast you can onboard. A **wildcard** certificate for
`*.myapp.com` covers every tenant that exists and every tenant that ever will —
but no CA will validate a wildcard over HTTP-01. It requires **DNS-01**: proving
you control the zone by publishing a `_acme-challenge` TXT record.

Add a `[server.tls.acme.dns]` section naming your DNS provider, and list the
wildcard in `domains`:

```toml
[server.tls.acme]
domains = ["myapp.com", "*.myapp.com"]
contact_email = "ops@myapp.com"
directory = "production"

[server.tls.acme.dns]
provider = "cloudflare"
```

That is the whole configuration. Everything else — issuance on first boot,
renewal before expiry with no restart, persistence across restarts, the staging
directory, the health indicator — is the same lifecycle the HTTP-01 path above
already has; only the challenge answer changes.

Onboarding a tenant after that costs **zero** certificate work: no issuance, no
restart, no config change. `tenant42.myapp.com` serves valid HTTPS from the
moment it resolves to your host.

### Supported providers

| `provider` | Credential fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudflare` | `api_token` | A scoped API token with **Zone:Read** *and* **DNS:Edit** on the zone — `Zone:Read` because the zone id is discovered from the record name. |
| `route53` | `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, optionally `session_token`, `hosted_zone_id`, `region` | Needs `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets` and `route53:ListResourceRecordSets` on the zone (plus `route53:ListHostedZonesByName` unless you set `hosted_zone_id`). |
| `exec` | none — the hook authenticates itself | The escape hatch: any other provider. See below. |

### Where the credential lives

**Never in `autumn.toml`.** The section has no field that could hold a token,
and it rejects unknown keys — so an `api_token = "..."` written into the config
file is a startup error naming the key, not a plaintext secret nobody notices.

Put it in the encrypted credentials store:

```console
$ autumn credentials edit
```

```console
$ autumn credentials edit --env prod
```

```toml
# config/credentials/prod.toml.enc (decrypted for editing)
[acme_dns]
api_token = "your-cloudflare-token"
```

> Pass the profile you will run under. `AUTUMN_ENV=production` resolves to the
> **`prod`** profile, so the server reads `config/credentials/prod.toml.enc` —
> while a bare `autumn credentials edit` writes `development.toml.enc`. A
> credentials file that does not exist loads as an *empty store*, so the
> mismatch surfaces as "no Cloudflare API token found" rather than as a missing
> file.

The table name is the `credential` key from `[server.tls.acme.dns]`, which
defaults to `acme_dns`. For Route 53 the same table carries the AWS fields:

```toml
[acme_dns]
access_key_id = "AKIA..."
secret_access_key = "..."
# optional; skips the hosted-zone lookup
hosted_zone_id = "Z0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ"
```

The store is decrypted with `AUTUMN_MASTER_KEY` (or `config/master.key`) exactly
like every other credential — see the [credentials guide](./credentials.md).

If you inject secrets through the environment instead, these variables override
the store, field for field:

| Variable | Field |
|---|---|
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_API_TOKEN` | `api_token` |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `access_key_id` |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `secret_access_key` |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_SESSION_TOKEN` | `session_token` |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` | `hosted_zone_id` |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_REGION` | `region` |

Tokens never reach logs, error messages, or `/actuator` output: the secret type
they are held in renders as `<redacted>`, and provider errors carry the API's
own message and status, never the request headers.

### The escape hatch: `provider = "exec"`

Any provider autumn does not ship support for — RFC 2136 dynamic updates, a
registrar's CLI, a webhook shim — is reachable through a hook program:

```toml
[server.tls.acme.dns]
provider = "exec"
command = ["/usr/local/bin/acme-dns-hook"]
```

Autumn runs it twice per challenge record, appending three arguments:

```console
$ /usr/local/bin/acme-dns-hook present _acme-challenge.myapp.com <txt-value>
$ /usr/local/bin/acme-dns-hook cleanup _acme-challenge.myapp.com <txt-value>
```

Exactly those three arguments are appended — no `--` marker, so `$1` is the
action. (A hook that forwards `"$@"` on to another CLI should insert its own
`--` there, since a challenge value is base64url and starts with `-` about once
in sixty-four.)

Exit `0` means the record was written (or removed); anything else fails the
order, with the hook's `stderr` quoted in the message. `command` is an **argv
array** run without a shell, so the record value is never interpreted as shell
syntax. A hook that has not finished within 120 seconds is killed, and its
output is read through a bounded buffer, so a hook that never stops writing
cannot grow the server.

**Credentials.** The hook inherits autumn's environment — that is how an
`nsupdate` or vendor-CLI hook is expected to authenticate, and autumn passes it
no secret of its own. Because that `stderr` is published (in logs, in the
operator alert, on `/actuator/health`), autumn scrubs it: every value the
environment holds under a credential-shaped name (`*TOKEN*`, `*SECRET*`,
`*KEY*`, `*PASSWORD*`, `*CREDENTIAL*`, `*AUTH*`) is replaced with `<redacted>`,
as are the DNS credentials autumn itself holds. That is a backstop, not a
guarantee — a credential in a variable named something like `MY_THING` is not
recognisable as one — so a hook still should not trace its own secrets to
`stderr`.

An RFC 2136 hook is a five-line script:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# $1 = present|cleanup, $2 = fqdn, $3 = value
[ "$1" = present ] && ACTION="add $2. 60 TXT \"$3\"" || ACTION="delete $2. TXT \"$3\""
printf 'server ns1.myapp.com\nupdate %s\nsend\n' "$ACTION" | nsupdate -k /etc/autumn/tsig.key
```

### Waiting for propagation

After writing the records, autumn waits until they are visible before telling
the CA to validate — signalling early is how a DNS-01 authorization gets burnt.

The probe goes to the zone's **authoritative** nameservers, not to the resolvers
you configure. That is deliberate, and it is the difference between a feature
that works and one that fails every renewal: a probe sent to a public recursive
resolver the instant the provider's API returns arrives *before* the record is
live on the zone's own servers, so the resolver answers `NXDOMAIN` and **caches
that negatively** for the zone's SOA minimum — 900s on Route 53, 1800s on
Cloudflare, both longer than the propagation budget. Every later probe would
then read the cached "not there". So `resolvers` is used to *discover* the
zone's nameservers (an `NS` lookup, then an `A` lookup per server), and the
propagation probe is sent to those directly. When discovery fails — a
split-horizon setup, a resolver that will not answer `NS` — autumn falls back to
probing `resolvers` directly and logs a warning.

Discovery runs once per distinct challenge name, so an order spanning several
domains probes each zone through *its own* nameservers. This matters: a
nameserver answers only for the zones it is authoritative for, so probing
`myapp.io`'s challenge record at `myapp.com`'s nameservers can never see the
record, and the wait would time out on an order that is in fact correct. An
apex + wildcard order challenges a single name, so the common case still costs
one discovery. Fallback is per name too — one domain with a broken delegation
does not pull the others onto recursive resolvers.

`[server.tls.acme.dns]` fields:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | required | `cloudflare`, `route53`, or `exec`. |
| `credential` | `acme_dns` | Key in the encrypted credentials store holding the provider credential. A key *name*, never a token. |
| `propagation_timeout_secs` | `300` | Give up if the records are still not visible after this long. Capped at `3600`. |
| `poll_interval_secs` | `5` | Gap between propagation probes. |
| `resolvers` | `["1.1.1.1:53", "8.8.8.8:53"]` | Resolvers used to discover the zone's nameservers, and probed directly if that fails. Each entry is an IP (port 53 implied) or `IP:port`; hostnames are rejected. |
| `command` | — | The `exec` hook's argv array. Required for `exec`, rejected for the others. |

A timeout names the exact record, the value that never appeared, and the
resolver that never saw it:

> DNS-01 propagation timed out after 300s: the TXT record
> `_acme-challenge.myapp.com` still does not carry `LPJNul-w…` at resolver
> `1.1.1.1:53` (the name does not exist yet). Check that the record was written
> to the zone that actually serves this name and that its NS delegation is live,
> then raise `[server.tls.acme.dns] propagation_timeout_secs` if the provider is
> simply slow.

Challenge records are removed after the order finishes — **including when it
fails**, so a retrying deployment does not fill the zone with dead
`_acme-challenge` entries.

### Two records, one name

An order for `myapp.com` **and** `*.myapp.com` produces two authorizations whose
TXT records share the name `_acme-challenge.myapp.com` but carry different
values. Both must be live at validation time. Every provider here appends a
value and deletes by `(name, value)`, never "replace the record set" — worth
knowing if you write your own `exec` hook, because `nsupdate delete <name> TXT`
without a value would remove its sibling and fail the order.

Route 53 is the exception that proves the rule: its API has no "append", only
`ChangeResourceRecordSets`, which replaces the whole set. Autumn therefore
read-modify-writes — and applies **both** values in a *single* change, because
Route 53 may keep serving the pre-change values until the first change reaches
`INSYNC`, so a second read-modify-write could read the old set and write back
only its own value, dropping the first. The same read-modify-write preserves
the set's existing **TTL**: the name can already hold another ACME client's
challenge values, so autumn's own 60-second TTL is written only when it is
creating the set — and Route 53 rejects a `DELETE` whose TTL differs from the
live set, so cleanup has to send the TTL that is actually there. If your `exec`
hook talks to an API shaped like that, batch the same way and preserve what you
did not set, or make the hook idempotent under a stale read.

### What DNS-01 does *not* need

- **Inbound port 80.** The CA never connects to your host for DNS-01. Autumn
  still *tries* to bind `http_challenge_port` for the HTTP→HTTPS redirect, but a
  bind failure is only a warning under DNS-01 — the app starts and serves HTTPS
  without it, so a container with no `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` is a supported
  deployment. `autumn doctor` grades an unreachable `:80` the same way.
- **A record for the wildcard.** `*.myapp.com` has no address record of its own;
  the tenant subdomains point at your host (a wildcard `A`/`AAAA` record, or one
  per tenant). Creating those is your one-time job — autumn only writes the
  ephemeral challenge TXT records.

### `autumn doctor` for DNS-01

Three checks cover the failure classes DNS-01 adds:

| Check | Grades |
|---|---|
| `acme_dns_credential` | The provider credential is readable and carries the fields the provider needs. **Fail** when missing — without it every issuance and renewal fails. |
| `acme_dns_propagation` | (`--online`) Public DNS can answer for `_acme-challenge.<domain>` at all. **Fail** on `SERVFAIL`/timeout — a broken delegation defeats a correctly-written record. **Warn** on leftover records from an interrupted run. |
| `acme_tenancy_domain` | `[tenancy] base_domain`'s subdomains are actually covered by `[server.tls.acme] domains`. **Fail** otherwise — every tenant host would serve a name mismatch. |

### Failure surfaces through health and alerts

A failed DNS-01 issuance or renewal — an expired provider token, a propagation
timeout, a provider outage — is recorded on the `acme` health indicator (with
`challenge: "dns-01"` and the provider name in its details, never a credential)
and raises the operator-alert
[`scheduled_task_failure`](./operator-alerts.md) condition for
`acme-renewal`. Because renewal starts `renew_before_days` (default 30) ahead of
expiry, that alert fires with weeks of validity left, and clears automatically
on the first successful renewal.

## Tenant custom domains (`[server.tls.acme.custom_domains]`)

Wildcard certificates cover `tenant42.myapp.com`. A B2B customer who wants
`app.clientco.com` needs a certificate of their own. Turn the feature on and
autumn does the whole journey: it hands each tenant exact DNS instructions,
independently confirms the hostname points here, orders one certificate per
hostname, serves it by SNI, routes requests on that `Host` to the owning
tenant, and renews it. There is no per-domain configuration — a thousand
tenants use the same twenty lines.

```toml
[server.tls.acme]
domains        = ["myapp.com", "*.myapp.com"]
contact_email  = "ops@myapp.com"
directory      = "production"

[server.tls.acme.custom_domains]
enabled          = true
ingress_hostname = "ingress.myapp.com"   # CNAME target for tenant subdomains
ingress_ipv4     = ["203.0.113.10"]      # A records, for tenant APEX domains
# ingress_ipv6   = ["2001:db8::10"]      # AAAA records
# store_dir                  = "config/acme/domains"  # the registry (0600 files)
# max_domains                = 1000
# cert_cache_size            = 256       # certificates held in memory at once
# issuance_per_domain_per_day = 5
# issuance_global_per_hour    = 50
# failure_backoff_secs        = 300      # doubles per consecutive failure
# max_failure_backoff_secs    = 86400
# poll_interval_secs          = 60
```

`ingress_hostname` is what tenants CNAME at. An **apex** domain
(`clientco.com`) cannot carry a CNAME, so it needs `ingress_ipv4` /
`ingress_ipv6` instead; set both kinds if you accept both.

### The tenant journey

Your app owns the screens; autumn owns the state. Register a hostname when a
tenant asks for it, show them what the framework says to publish, and render
the status.

Autumn refuses a hostname the deployment already serves — anything under
`[server.tls.acme] domains` or `[tenancy] base_domain` — so one tenant cannot
connect another's subdomain. **Per-tenant quotas are yours**: `max_domains` is
deployment-wide, so cap registrations per tenant in your own code if one tenant
must not be able to spend the whole budget.

```rust
use autumn_web::custom_domain::{CustomDomainPruner, CustomDomainRegistry, DnsInstructions};

let registry = CustomDomainRegistry::from_state(&state).expect("custom domains are enabled");
let ingress = config.server.tls.as_ref()
    .and_then(|t| t.acme.as_ref())
    .and_then(|a| a.custom_domains.as_ref())
    .map(|cd| cd.ingress())
    .unwrap_or_default();

// 1. Connect. Your app decides who may — plan, entitlement, per-tenant quota.
let domain = registry.register("app.clientco.com", &tenant_id, now_unix).await?;

// 2. Show the tenant exactly what to publish. Fields are tab-separated.
let instructions = DnsInstructions::for_hostname(&domain.hostname, &ingress)?;
println!("{}", instructions.render());   // app.clientco.com\tCNAME\tingress.myapp.com

// 3. Render status, including why it is stuck.
for d in registry.list_for_tenant(&tenant_id) {
    println!("{} — {} {}", d.hostname, d.status, d.failure_reason.unwrap_or_default());
}

// 4. Offboard. Routing, serving and renewal stop AND the certificate is deleted.
let domains = <dyn CustomDomainPruner>::from_state(&state).expect("custom domains are enabled");
domains.offboard_domain("app.clientco.com").await?;
domains.offboard_tenant_domains(&tenant_id).await?;   // every domain the tenant owns
```

`registry.remove` forgets the registration only — routing and serving stop, but
the certificate stays in the ACME store. Offboard through `CustomDomainPruner`
so the private key goes too.

The states are `pending_dns` → `verified` → `issuing` → `active`. There is no
separate failed state: a domain that fails carries a `failure_reason` and a
`next_attempt_unix`, and one that already reached `active` **stays** `active`
while it retries — a failed renewal never takes a live tenant offline.

Once a domain is `active`, requests carrying that `Host` resolve to its tenant.
The usual `[tenancy] base_domain` rejection does not apply to a registered
domain, and subdomain tenancy is unchanged for every other host.

### Abuse posture toward the CA

Custom domains mean tenant-supplied hostnames drive certificate orders, so
three gates stand between a hostname and Let's Encrypt:

1. **Registration.** Only a hostname your app registered is known at all. An
   SNI hostname nobody registered is refused at the TLS handshake, and no code
   path from there reaches the ACME provider.
2. **Verification.** No order is created until autumn independently resolves
   the hostname and finds it pointing at this deployment. A domain whose DNS
   points elsewhere sits at `pending_dns` with the observed address in its
   `failure_reason` and costs the CA nothing.
3. **Budget.** At the defaults, at most **5 orders per domain per day** and
   **50 across the whole deployment per hour** — comfortably inside Let's
   Encrypt's 300-new-orders-per-account-per-3-hours limit. Failures back off
   exponentially from 5 minutes to a day, so a permanently broken domain
   converges to roughly one attempt a day rather than one a tick.

Tenant certificates are ordered over **HTTP-01** even when your own certificate
uses DNS-01: the record lives in the *tenant's* zone, where autumn holds no
credential. That is the same condition verification already proved, so
`:80` must reach this deployment for tenant domains to issue.

Every tenant order uses the **same ACME account** as your own certificate, so
the CA sees one registration however many domains connect.

### Scale and restarts

The registry is one `0600` JSON file per domain, loaded into an in-memory index
before the listener binds — a restart routes and serves every connected domain
on the first request. Certificates load **incrementally**: at most
`cert_cache_size` are held in memory, and a handshake for a colder domain reads
its certificate back from the store and caches it. Nothing requires every
certificate to be resident, so `cert_cache_size` is a memory knob, not a
correctness one.

Custom domains live **inside** the ACME TLS listener, so they exist only where
autumn terminates TLS itself. Behind
[reverse-proxy termination](#terminating-tls-at-a-reverse-proxy) there is no
registry and no `Host`-based tenant routing — the proxy owns the certificates
and your app owns the mapping.

Ordering is leader-elected per domain through the same `SchedulerCoordinator`
the deployment's own renewal uses, so replicas do not race the CA. Everything
else about the ACME path is still single-host: the HTTP-01 token map and the
certificate store are per-process, so behind a load balancer the CA's
validation request usually reaches a replica that never published the token.
Run custom domains on a single host.

### Offboarding and retention

`offboard_domain` (or `offboard_tenant_domains`) stops routing, stops serving,
halts renewal, drops the cached certificate and deletes the stored pair. Beyond
that, the
`custom_domains`
[retention dataset](./data-retention.md) prunes two things the app cannot: a
registration that never reached DNS verification within its window, and a stored
certificate for a hostname no longer registered at all.

```toml
[retention]
custom_domains = "30d"   # drop connections abandoned before DNS was ever published
```

A registry that cannot be read at boot disables custom-domain **connections**
as well as routing: an index that hydrated nothing cannot tell whether a
hostname already belongs to someone, so `register` refuses with "the
custom-domain registry has not loaded" rather than overwriting the durable
record of whoever owns it. The deployment's own certificate keeps serving; fix
the store and restart.

A registry that could read only *some* of its records refuses connections the
same way: the records that did load keep routing and renewing, but `register`
refuses every hostname — naming the skipped record files, the same names
`autumn doctor` reports as a warning — until the files are restored or deleted
and the server restarts. With a hostname missing from the index the registry
cannot tell a free hostname from one whose record is corrupt, and connecting
it would overwrite the durable record of whoever owns it and hand their domain
to another tenant at the next restart. The retention prune refuses to run over
the incomplete index for the same reason: every certificate would read as an
orphan.

### What doctor checks

| Check | What it catches |
|---|---|
| `custom_domains` | The section loads, has somewhere for tenants to point, and its cap is not already exceeded. **Fail** on anything the server would exit at boot on. |
| `custom_domain_dns` | (`--online`) Each registered domain still points here. **Fail** for an `active` or `verified` domain whose DNS has moved away or vanished — it is serving a certificate nobody can reach and will fail its next renewal. **Warn** for one still `pending_dns`. Probes the first 25 domains and says so. |
| `custom_domain_http01` | (`--online`) Port 80 is reachable on **every address** each configured ingress target resolves to — one member of a load-balancer record set that drops it fails HTTP-01 for whatever share of tenants lands there. **Fail** when any is unreachable — tenant certificates are always issued over HTTP-01, so a closed port 80 blocks every one of them **even under a DNS-01 deployment**, where `acme_ports` rightly calls it optional for the deployment's own certificate. |

### Failure surfaces through health and alerts

The `custom_domains` health indicator reports how many domains are registered
and active, and names every unhealthy one **with its tenant** — so an operator
reading `/actuator/health` can act without a registry lookup. It is `Down` only
when a certificate has actually expired: one tenant's pending retry is not a
deployment outage. A failed order also raises the
[`scheduled_task_failure`](./operator-alerts.md) alert for
`custom_domain_certificates`, naming the domain and tenant, and that alert
clears when the **last** failing domain recovers — or is offboarded, since a
domain that no longer exists is not still failing.

A renewal skipped because the domain stopped pointing here is recorded the same
way. The certificate keeps serving until it expires, so the domain stays
`active`, but the reason and the alert appear immediately rather than at expiry,
when it would already be down: either the tenant restores the record or the
domain should be offboarded.

## Mutual TLS: verifying client certificates (`[server.tls.client_auth]`)

Everything above secures *who the client is talking to*. Mutual TLS (mTLS)
secures the other half: **who is calling**. The app requests a certificate
during the handshake, verifies it against a CA bundle you supply, and hands the
verified identity to your handlers and policies — so an internal API can be
locked to known machines without an mTLS-terminating proxy in front.

This is machine identity: service-to-service calls, partner APIs, zero-trust
networks. Autumn *verifies* client certificates; it does not issue them. Use
your own CA, Vault PKI, SPIRE, or `cert-manager` to mint them.

Needs the `tls` feature. With the `[server.tls.client_auth]` section absent, the
handshake is byte-for-byte the server-only TLS above — nothing changes.

### Configuration

```toml
[server.tls]
cert_path = "/etc/autumn/tls/fullchain.pem"
key_path  = "/etc/autumn/tls/privkey.pem"

[server.tls.client_auth]
mode           = "optional"                          # off (default) | optional | required
ca_bundle_path = "/etc/autumn/tls/client-ca.pem"     # one or more PEM CAs
crl_path       = "/etc/autumn/tls/client-ca.crl.pem" # optional revocation list
required_paths = ["/internal/"]                      # routes that demand a certificate
# reload_interval_secs = 60                          # bundle/CRL poll interval
```

Ten lines, and an internal route is locked to a client CA.

**Modes** are per listener:

| `mode` | Handshake | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `off` (default) | No certificate requested. | Server-only TLS. |
| `optional` | Certificate requested; a client that presents one must pass verification, a client that presents none still connects. | One process serves public routes **and** mTLS-only routes. |
| `required` | Handshake fails without a valid certificate. | The whole listener is machine-to-machine. |

`optional` is not "unverified": a client that *offers* a certificate must still
chain to a configured CA. The option is whether presenting one is mandatory.

A `process.role = "worker"` replica serves only the probes and the actuator,
but it serves them over the same listener, so `required_paths` applies there
too — a prefix covering `/actuator/` holds on every role.

Prefixes are taken as written. Startup refuses a noncanonical entry — an empty
segment (`//`) or a `.` / `..` segment — because it would protect less than it
appears to. Write the resolved prefix.

**Per-route requirements** come from `required_paths`, matched at segment
boundaries — so `/internal/` covers `/internal/keys` but not `/internal-tools`.
A requirement matches the raw request path AND the normalized one, and demands
a certificate if either matches: `/open/../internal/keys` cannot slip in, and
`/internal/%2e%2e` — which normalizes to `/` but which the router still
dispatches to `/internal/{id}` — cannot slip out.

A request reaching one of these over a connection with no verified
certificate is rejected with **`403 Forbidden`** and the standard JSON error
envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "https://autumn.dev/problems/forbidden",
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "code": "autumn.forbidden",
  "detail": "this route requires a verified client certificate (mTLS)",
  "errors": []
}
```

`403`, not `401`: there is no credential the client could re-send on this
connection, so a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge would be meaningless.

For a requirement in code rather than config, layer a sub-router:

```rust
use autumn_web::tls::client_auth::RequireClientCertLayer;

let internal = Router::new()
    .route("/keys", get(rotate_keys))
    .layer(RequireClientCertLayer::new());
```

These compose: a route can be covered by `required_paths`, by the layer, by the
`ClientCert` extractor below, or by all three.

### The verified identity in handlers

```rust
use autumn_web::tls::client_auth::{ClientCert, OptionalClientCert};

// Rejects with 403 when the connection carries no verified certificate.
async fn rotate_keys(ClientCert(client): ClientCert) -> String {
    format!("caller {} (fingerprint {})", client.subject, client.fingerprint)
}

// Never rejects — serves machines and people from one route.
async fn whoami(OptionalClientCert(client): OptionalClientCert) -> String {
    client.map_or_else(|| "anonymous".into(), |c| c.subject.clone())
}
```

`ClientIdentity` carries:

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `subject` | `O=Acme, OU=Services, CN=svc-orders` |
| `issuer` | `O=Acme, CN=Acme Internal Client CA` |
| `sans` | `["DNS:svc-orders.internal", "URI:spiffe://acme/svc/orders"]` |
| `fingerprint` | `sha256:9f86d0…` |
| `serial` | `139C8A13442053B0…` |
| `not_after_unix` | `4102444800` |

`common_name()` returns the subject's `CN` and `has_san("URI:…")` matches a SAN
including its kind prefix. Both read the **parsed** certificate.

> **Authorize on `common_name()` and `has_san()`, never on `subject`.** The DN
> strings render attributes in certificate order (not the reversed order
> `openssl -nameopt rfc2253` prints) and do not escape attribute values, so a
> subject whose `O` happens to contain `, CN=svc-payments` renders exactly like
> two real attributes. A CA that copies `O` from a CSR would then let a caller
> pick its own identity out of a string search. `common_name()` cannot be
> spoofed that way. `DNS:` SANs compare case-insensitively; every other kind
> compares exactly.

These compose with session auth on the same router: `Auth<T>` and `RequireAuth`
read the request, `ClientCert` reads the connection, and neither consults the
other.

### Machine identity in a policy

The same identity is on the `PolicyContext`, alongside the session user and
token scopes, so an `#[authorize]` policy can decide on the calling *service*:

```rust
impl Policy<ApiKey> for ApiKeyPolicy {
    fn can_update<'a>(&'a self, ctx: &'a PolicyContext, key: &'a ApiKey)
        -> BoxFuture<'a, bool>
    {
        Box::pin(async move {
            // Only the orders service may rotate its own keys.
            ctx.client_has_san("URI:spiffe://acme/svc/orders")
                && key.service == "orders"
        })
    }
}
```

`ctx.has_client_identity()` asks whether the connection was verified at all;
`ctx.client_identity()` returns the full record.

The identity is scoped to the task serving the request, like
[`Current::actor()`](./audit-logging.md) — a policy check moved onto a
`tokio::spawn`ed task sees `None`. To exercise such a policy in a unit test,
wrap the call in `autumn_web::tls::client_auth::with_client_identity(...)`.

### CA rotation without a restart

The bundle and CRL hot-reload on the same mechanism the server certificate uses
— a modification-time poll, `reload_interval_secs` apart. A rotation is two
edits, no restart, and no dropped connection:

1. **Overlap.** Append the new CA to the bundle, so old and new are both
   trusted. Re-issue client certificates from the new CA at your leisure.
2. **Retire.** Remove the old CA from the bundle.

```console
$ cat old-ca.pem new-ca.pem > /etc/autumn/tls/client-ca.pem   # step 1
$ cp new-ca.pem /etc/autumn/tls/client-ca.pem                 # step 2, later
```

rustls verifies once, at handshake time, so a connection established under the
old bundle keeps serving after step 2 — the swap only affects handshakes that
start after it. A bundle that fails to load logs an error and keeps the previous
trust store: a bad rotation never takes the listener down.

### Revocation

**The recommended baseline is short-lived client certificates plus CA rotation**,
not a revocation list. A certificate that lives hours cannot be usefully revoked,
and a CA rotation retires a whole generation at once. Reach for a CRL when a
single certificate must be killed before it expires.

`crl_path` points at a PEM revocation list issued by a CA in the bundle. It
hot-reloads like the bundle, so publishing a revocation takes effect within one
poll interval, and a connection presenting a revoked certificate is rejected at
the handshake — visible in the logs and the metrics below.

Two deliberate choices:

- **Only the presented certificate's revocation status is checked**, not the
  whole chain. A single CRL from the issuing CA cannot speak for intermediates,
  and chain-depth checking would reject every certificate under an intermediate
  as "unknown status".
- **A stale CRL keeps working.** If `nextUpdate` has passed, autumn keeps
  honoring the list rather than failing every handshake — the revocations it
  names stay enforced. `autumn doctor` warns so the staleness is not silent.

**OCSP and OCSP stapling are not supported.** CRL plus short-lived certificates
first.

### TLS session resumption is off under client auth

A listener with `mode` other than `off` disables TLS session resumption — both
the session cache and TLS 1.3 tickets. rustls restores a resumed connection's
peer certificate from the stored session and does **not** re-run the verifier,
so a client whose CA you rotated out (or whose certificate you just revoked)
would otherwise keep reconnecting on a resumed session until it expired — and
would keep presenting a verified-looking identity to your handlers. That is the
one hole a swappable trust store cannot close by swapping, because the check it
swaps is never run.

The cost is a full handshake per connection. For a listener whose purpose is
deciding who may connect, that is the right trade. Server-only TLS
(`[server.tls]` without this section) keeps resumption exactly as it was.

### Failure diagnostics

A rejected handshake is invisible to the client beyond the standard TLS alert —
no reason is ever put on the wire, so a prober learns nothing about the trust
store. Operator-side, every rejection is counted and logged with a
distinguishing reason:

| Reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `no_certificate` | Nothing presented on a `required` listener. |
| `untrusted_ca` | Chains to no CA in the bundle. |
| `expired` | Past its `notAfter`. |
| `not_yet_valid` | Its `notBefore` has not arrived — usually clock skew. |
| `revoked` | Listed in the CRL. |
| `unknown_revocation` | Revocation status undeterminable. |
| `invalid` | Malformed, bad signature, or otherwise unacceptable. |

```
WARN rejected an mTLS client certificate reason=untrusted_ca peer=10.0.3.7:51422 suppressed=0
```

The reason is classified where the handshake fails, so `no_certificate` — which
rustls raises without ever consulting the trust store — is counted and logged
like the rest.

Rejections are attacker-triggerable, so the log is rate-limited to one line per
second per reason; lines held back are reported in the next one's `suppressed`
field. The **counters are exact** regardless:

- `tls_client_auth_rejected_total{reason="…"}` — handshakes rejected.
- `tls_client_auth_route_rejected_total` — requests that reached an
  mTLS-only route with no verified certificate.

Both surface through the usual metrics/actuator endpoints.

Startup **fails fast** with the offending path in the message on a missing,
unparseable, or empty CA bundle or CRL — the listener never binds trusting
nobody.

### `autumn doctor`

`autumn doctor` grades the mTLS surface offline, as the `tls_client_auth` check:

- **Fail** — the bundle or CRL is missing, unparseable, or empty (the same
  conditions the runtime refuses to boot on), or a CA in the bundle has expired.
- **Warn** — a CA expires within 30 days, the CRL's `nextUpdate` has passed, or
  `mode = "optional"` with no route requiring a certificate (client auth
  configured and enforcing nothing).
- **Pass** — otherwise, reporting the mode, the CA count, and how many route
  prefixes demand a certificate.

### Posture manifest

A route's mTLS requirement is a dimension of the [security posture
manifest](./security-posture-manifest.md): `autumn routes posture diff` raises
`mtls_requirement_removed` (**widening**, blocks until acknowledged) when a
route that demanded a certificate stops demanding one, and `mtls_mode_weakened`
when the listener mode itself drops a rank. So a refactor cannot quietly unlock
an internal API.

### End to end: a dev client CA in ten minutes

Generate a CA and one client certificate with `openssl`:

```console

`mkcert -client` can mint a client certificate from the mkcert CA if you would
rather not run the two commands above; use `mkcert` for the *server* certificate
either way (see [Local development
certificates](#local-development-certificates-mkcert)). Point `ca_bundle_path`
at whichever CA signed the client certificate — mkcert's `rootCA.pem` or the one
generated here.

Point the app at the CA, keeping `/internal/` mTLS-only:

```toml
[server.tls]
cert_path = "localhost.pem"
key_path  = "localhost-key.pem"

[server.tls.client_auth]
mode           = "optional"
ca_bundle_path = "client-ca.pem"
required_paths = ["/internal/"]
```

Then smoke-test the whole matrix with `curl`:

```console
# Valid certificate → 200
$ curl --cacert rootCA.pem --cert svc-orders.pem --key svc-orders.key.pem \
    https://localhost:8443/internal/keys
rotated

# No certificate → 403 with the JSON envelope
$ curl --cacert rootCA.pem https://localhost:8443/internal/keys
{"type":"https://autumn.dev/problems/forbidden","title":"Forbidden","status":403,
 "code":"autumn.forbidden","detail":"this route requires a verified client certificate (mTLS)"}

# Public routes are unaffected
$ curl --cacert rootCA.pem https://localhost:8443/health
ok

# A certificate from another CA → handshake rejected, no HTTP response
$ curl --cacert rootCA.pem --cert other.pem --key other.key.pem \
    https://localhost:8443/internal/keys
curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: ... alert unknown ca
```

With `mode = "required"` the second call fails at the handshake instead of
returning `403` — the listener never lets an uncertified client speak HTTP at
all.

### Revoking a certificate

```console
$ openssl ca -config ca.cnf -revoke svc-retired.pem
$ openssl ca -config ca.cnf -gencrl -out client-ca.crl.pem
```

Add `crl_path = "client-ca.crl.pem"`; the next poll picks it up, and
`svc-retired` is rejected at the handshake while its siblings keep working.

### Not in this slice

- **Proxy-forwarded client-certificate headers** (XFCC-style) are never trusted.
  The identity comes from the handshake this process performed, or there is
  none.
- **mTLS on outbound calls** (`http_client`) and database connections.
- **Mapping certificates to human user accounts** (PIV / smart-card login).
  Machine identity only.

## Terminating TLS at a reverse proxy

If a reverse proxy or platform already fronts your app, terminate TLS there and
let the app serve plain HTTP behind it. This is the right choice for the managed
`autumn deploy` flow and for multi-replica deployments behind a shared load
balancer.

The push-button [`autumn deploy`](./deployment.md#push-button-deploy-to-your-own-server-autumn-deploy)
path installs **kamal-proxy** in front of your app. kamal-proxy listens on your
configured public HTTP port (`server.port`) and, **by default, 443** — its HTTPS
listener is always bound and cannot be disabled, regardless of any app's TLS
setting. By default `autumn deploy` provisions **no** certificate for your app,
so nothing is served over HTTPS until you opt in. You enable TLS termination
**at the deploy-managed proxy** with an opt-in `[deploy.tls]` table:

```toml
[deploy.tls]
enabled = true
host = "app.example.com"   # public DNS name the certificate is issued for
```

With `[deploy.tls] enabled = true`, `autumn deploy` passes `--host <host> --tls`
on every kamal-proxy `route`/`flip` for your app, so kamal-proxy provisions an
**automatic Let's Encrypt** certificate for `host` on-demand and terminates TLS
for it on its always-bound 443 listener. This needs **no `server.port` change**
— issuance uses TLS-ALPN-01 on the already-bound 443, so it works on both the
first deploy and a later redeploy (enabling TLS on an already-deployed app never
restarts or reconfigures the shared proxy). With the table absent (the default)
the route/flip commands carry **no** `--host`/`--tls`, so the proxy serves your
app over plain HTTP only — byte-for-byte the historical behavior.

**Setting `server.port = 80` is recommended** (it is the default) so the proxy
also serves plain HTTP on 80 and can offer the HTTP→HTTPS redirect for visitors
who hit `http://`. It is **not required** for certificate issuance.

> **An external TLS terminator sharing the same host is not supported.** Because
> kamal-proxy always binds 443 and its HTTPS listener cannot be disabled, you
> cannot put your own nginx/Caddy/load-balancer TLS terminator on 443 on the
> same host as the deploy-managed proxy — the two would collide. Terminate TLS
> at kamal-proxy via `[deploy.tls]`, or run the terminator on a **separate**
> host/load balancer in front of the deploy host.

Either way TLS terminates at the **proxy**, not the app. Do **not** enable
in-process `[server.tls]`/ACME on a deploy-managed app: `autumn deploy` binds each app slot to a private loopback
**HTTP** port (the slot systemd unit sets `AUTUMN_SERVER__HOST=127.0.0.1`), the
readiness gate probes it over plain HTTP (`curl http://127.0.0.1:{port}/ready`),
and kamal-proxy routes to a plain `127.0.0.1:{port}` target — so putting a TLS
listener there would fail both the health checks and the plain-HTTP proxy hop.
When TLS is terminated in front, the app needs **neither** the `tls` **nor** the
`acme` cargo feature and **no** `[server.tls]` section — the terminating proxy
owns the certificate.

In-process [`[server.tls]`](#direct-in-process-tls-servertls) and
[ACME](#automatic-acme-certificates-servertlsacme) (the sections above) remain
the right choice for a **self-run / standalone** app you start yourself — one
that owns its own public host:port, not one deployed via `autumn deploy`.

The same applies to any terminating proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer):
point the proxy's certificate at the public `https://` port and forward to the
app's HTTP port. For the full `autumn deploy` walkthrough, fly.io, and
container-based deployment, see the [deployment guide](./deployment.md).
