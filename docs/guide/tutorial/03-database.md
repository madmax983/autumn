# Chapter 3: Database Setup

**Goal:** By the end of this chapter, you will have a Postgres database running
in Docker, the Diesel CLI installed, a `todos` table created via migration,
and your Autumn app connecting to the database on startup.

---

## Sections

### Starting Postgres with Docker Compose

Creating `docker-compose.yml` for a local Postgres instance. Starting and
verifying the database.

### Installing the Diesel CLI

`cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres` and
verifying the installation.

### Configuring the Database Connection

Uncommenting the `[database]` section in `autumn.toml` and setting the
primary/write connection URL. How Autumn's config system keeps legacy
single-URL apps valid while also supporting explicit primary/replica topology.

### Creating Your First Migration

`diesel setup` and `diesel migration generate create_todos`. Writing the
`up.sql` (CREATE TABLE) and `down.sql` (DROP TABLE) scripts.

### Running Migrations

`diesel migration run` to apply the migration. Verifying the table exists.

### The `schema.rs` File

How `diesel print-schema` generates the Diesel schema module. Understanding
the `diesel::table!` macro output. Why `schema.rs` is generated, not
hand-written.

### Verifying the Connection

Starting the app with `cargo run` and confirming the "Database pool
configured" log message.

### Checkpoint

Expected project state with database configured and migration applied.
