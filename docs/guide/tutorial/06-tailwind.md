# Chapter 6: Styling with Tailwind CSS

**Goal:** By the end of this chapter, your todo app will have a polished visual
design using Tailwind utility classes, and you will understand how the
`build.rs` CSS pipeline works.

## Sections

### How the Build Pipeline Works

The compile-time flow: `build.rs` runs the Tailwind CLI, which scans
`src/**/*.rs` for class names in string literals, generates only the CSS you
use, and writes `static/css/autumn.css`. Autumn serves this file from
`/static/css/autumn.css`.

### Adding Tailwind Classes to Maud Templates

Classes in Maud are just string attributes: `class="bg-gray-100 min-h-screen"`.
Styling the layout, the todo list, form inputs, and buttons.

### Responsive Design Basics

Using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to make the
layout work on different screen sizes.

### The Static File Serving Pipeline

How Autumn auto-mounts the `static/` directory at `/static/`. The CSS link
in the layout, the htmx script tag, and adding custom assets.

### Custom CSS

Adding your own styles below the `@tailwind` directives in `input.css` for
anything Tailwind does not cover.

### Checkpoint

Expected project state with styled templates.
