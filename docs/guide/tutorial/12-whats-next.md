# Chapter 12: What's Next

**Goal:** By the end of this chapter, you will have a complete, working todo
application and a clear picture of where to go from here.

This tutorial tracks the published Autumn 0.4.x line and Rust 1.88.0+ as of
2026-05-11. If you are following `trunk` from a checkout, confirm the
workspace version before copying dependency snippets.

## Sections

### What You Built

Recap of the full application: project scaffolding, route macros, Postgres
with Diesel, Maud templates, Tailwind CSS styling, htmx interactivity, a
JSON API, structured error handling, and production configuration. All from
one framework dependency.

### Comparing to the Reference Implementation

Your code vs. `examples/todo-app/`. Any polish the example includes that the
tutorial omitted. Then branch out into the newer example apps:

- `examples/blog/` for hybrid rendering and a richer admin UI
- `examples/bookmarks/` for repository macros, generated CRUD APIs, and scheduled tasks
- `examples/wiki/` for mutation hooks and revision history
- `examples/signed-webhooks/` for signed third-party callback intake and replay fixtures

### Ideas for Extending the App

- **Authentication** -- add user accounts with session cookies
- **Actuator hardening** -- tune which operational endpoints stay visible in prod
- **Background work** -- add a `#[scheduled]` task for cleanup or polling
- **Third-party callbacks** -- add signed Stripe/GitHub/Slack-style webhooks
- **Categories** -- associate todos with categories (a second table, foreign keys)
- **Search** -- add a search bar with `ILIKE` queries
- **Pagination** -- limit the list with `.limit()` and `.offset()`
- **Testing** — see [Chapter 11](11-testing.md) for the integration testing walkthrough
