# Tutorial: Build a Todo App with Autumn

This tutorial walks you through building a complete todo application from an
empty directory to a working full-stack app. You will use every major feature
of the Autumn framework: route macros, Diesel database access, Maud HTML
templates, Tailwind CSS styling, htmx interactivity, a JSON API, and
structured error handling.

The app you build here is the same one in `examples/todo-app/`. The tutorial
is the narrative; the example is the reference implementation. If you get
stuck, compare your code against the example.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (edition 2024) with `cargo` on your PATH
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for Postgres, starting in Chapter 3)
- **~2 hours** for the full tutorial, or work through chapters at your own pace

## Chapters

1. [Project Setup](01-project-setup.md) — scaffold a project, run hello-world
2. [Routes and Handlers](02-routes.md) — define endpoints with macros
3. [Database Setup](03-database.md) — Postgres, Docker, Diesel migrations
4. [Models and Queries](04-models.md) — Diesel models, the `Db` extractor, CRUD
5. [HTML Templates with Maud](05-templates.md) — type-safe HTML rendering
6. [Styling with Tailwind CSS](06-tailwind.md) — the `build.rs` CSS pipeline
7. [Interactivity with htmx](07-htmx.md) — toggle, delete, partial responses
8. [JSON API](08-json-api.md) — `Json<T>` for request and response
9. [Error Handling](09-errors.md) — `AutumnResult`, status codes, validation
10. [Configuration and Production Defaults](10-configuration.md) — `autumn.toml`, env vars, logging
11. [Writing Integration Tests](11-testing.md) — `TestApp`, `TestDb`, smoke tests and DB round-trips
12. [What's Next](12-whats-next.md) — extending the app, further reading

## How to Use This Tutorial

Each chapter builds on the previous one. Start from Chapter 1 and work
forward. Every chapter opens with a goal statement telling you what you will
have by the end, and closes with a checkpoint showing the expected project
state.

Code listings show only the new or changed code. When you need to see the
full file at any point, check the corresponding checkpoint or refer to
`examples/todo-app/`.

If you have already read the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started.md),
you can skim Chapter 1 — it covers similar ground but establishes the project
you will build on for the rest of the tutorial.

## Want the short version?

If you're already comfortable with Rust web frameworks and just want a
working CRUD app, the [Code Generators guide](../generators.md) collapses
this whole tutorial into five commands:

```bash
autumn new my-app
cd my-app
autumn generate scaffold Post title:String body:Text published:bool
autumn migrate
autumn dev
```

The tutorial explains *why* each piece exists; the generators guide
shows *how* to skip the typing once you know.
