## At a glance

- **Old version:** `autumn-web {X.Y.Z}`
- **New version:** `autumn-web {X.Z.0}`
- **Expected upgrade effort:** {S / M / L — one paragraph of context}
- **MSRV delta:** `{old MSRV}` → `{new MSRV}` ({reason, or "unchanged"})
- **Carried dependency majors:** {e.g. `axum 0.8 → 0.9`, `diesel 2 → 3`,
  or "none"}

## Summary

One paragraph describing *why* this release is major. Prefer "we want
these properties, and they required breaking change `X`" over a list of
unrelated removals.

Link to the [CHANGELOG entry](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the release for the
full commit-level picture.

## Before you start

- Pin your existing version (`autumn-web = "={X.Y.Z}"`) and commit.
- Run `cargo update` *before* the upgrade so the subsequent diff is just
  the major bump.
- Make sure your test suite is green on the old version. You will want
  the safety net.

## Step-by-step

1. **Run `autumn upgrade`** — *before* the dependency bump. The release it
   migrates from is the one your `Cargo.toml` still records, so bumping first
   leaves nothing in range. It previews every mechanical change this release
   can apply to your own source — a per-file diff plus a count of affected
   sites — and writes nothing; re-run with `--apply` to take them. Anything it
   cannot safely rewrite is listed with `file:line` and a link to the guide
   section that explains it.

   ```bash
   cargo install autumn-cli --version {X.Z.0}
   autumn upgrade            # preview
   autumn upgrade --apply    # take it
   ```

2. **Bump the dependency.**
   ```toml
   # Cargo.toml
   [dependencies]
   autumn-web = "{(X+1).0}"
   ```

3. **Run `cargo check`.** Work through the compiler errors section by
   section using the cheat sheet below. Only the changes labelled `review` or
   `manual` above should still need you.

4. **Apply configuration changes** (see
   [Configuration changes](#configuration-changes)).

5. **Run the test suite.**

6. **Run the application locally** and exercise each feature at least
   once. Pay attention to the [Behavior changes](#behavior-changes)
   section.

## Breaking changes

Repeat the block below for each breaking change. Keep changes grouped by
area (routing / config / database / …) so readers can skip to what they
care about.

### {Area}: {Short description}

**Why:** One or two sentences on the motivation.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
// paste a minimal, compiling example from the old version
```

**After (`{(X+1).0}`):**

```rust
// paste the equivalent on the new version
```

**Automation:** `manual` — {why no codemod applies: it needs new arguments, it
is a configuration or behaviour change, it is only reachable inside a macro, ….
For a change `autumn upgrade` *does* rewrite, use `auto` (safe by construction:
renames and import moves) or `review` (rewritten, every site flagged for a
human) instead, and name the shipped codemod id from
`autumn-cli/src/upgrade/migrations.rs` in this paragraph.}

Every breaking change carries this label — `scripts/check-migration-guides.sh`
fails without it, and fails an `auto`/`review` label that names no shipped
codemod, or a rename-level change left `manual` with no reason (issue #1629).

### TLS: `TlsConfig`, `TlsError` and `SecurityDump` gain mTLS members (#1640)

**Why:** mutual TLS needs a trust store in `[server.tls]`, error variants that
name what went wrong with it, and a posture-manifest field for the routes that
require it. Each is additive at the *config* and *document* level — an absent
`[server.tls.client_auth]` section and a v3 manifest both behave exactly as
before — but each also widens a Rust type that user code can name.

Three types moved. You are affected only if your code constructs or matches one
of them exhaustively; none of them changes meaning.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::config::TlsConfig;

let tls = TlsConfig {
    cert_path: Some("fullchain.pem".into()),
    key_path: Some("privkey.pem".into()),
    reload_interval_secs: 60,
    handshake_timeout_secs: 10,
    acme: None,
};

match tls_error {
    autumn_web::tls::TlsError::Expired { .. } => …,
    // an exhaustive match over every variant
}
```

**After (`{(X+1).0}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::config::TlsConfig;

let tls = TlsConfig {
    cert_path: Some("fullchain.pem".into()),
    key_path: Some("privkey.pem".into()),
    reload_interval_secs: 60,
    handshake_timeout_secs: 10,
    acme: None,
    client_auth: None,   // new: no client-certificate verification
};

match tls_error {
    autumn_web::tls::TlsError::Expired { .. } => …,
    // `TlsError` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`; add a catch-all arm
    _ => …,
}
```

`autumn_web::route_listing::SecurityDump` gains `client_auth`, the snapshot the
security-posture manifest reads. Fill it with `ClientAuthDump::off()` unless you
are modelling an mTLS deployment. The type exists to carry the dump across the
`autumn routes audit` boundary, so a literal construction is rare outside tests.

`TlsError`, `ClientAuthMode`, `RejectionReason`, `CaInspection` and
`CrlInspection` are all `#[non_exhaustive]` from this release, so the next
variant or field added to any of them will not break you again.

**Automation:** `manual` — the fix is a field initializer or a match arm whose
correct value depends on what the surrounding code is modelling, so no codemod
can choose it. Both shapes surface as a compiler error (`E0063` for the missing
field, `E0004` for the non-exhaustive match), never as a silent behaviour change.

### Audit: `AuditEvent` gains a `metadata` field

**Why:** A retention sweep has to record three facts — which dataset, what
cutoff, and how many rows it removed (issue #1605) — and `AuditEvent` had
nowhere to put them. `metadata` is a flat `BTreeMap<String, String>` rather
than arbitrary JSON so `AuditEvent` keeps `Eq` and a deterministic,
key-ordered serialization, which is the shape SIEM ingestion expects. It is
`#[serde(default)]` and skipped when empty, so **archives written before this
release still deserialize and existing archive lines are unchanged.**

Only code that constructs or destructures `AuditEvent` *by struct literal* has
to change. `AuditEvent::new(...)` is unaffected, and so is every read of an
existing field.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::audit::{AuditEvent, AuditStatus};

let event = AuditEvent {
    timestamp: chrono::Utc::now(),
    actor_id: "admin-1".into(),
    action: "user.role.update".into(),
    target_resource_id: "user-99".into(),
    ip_address: None,
    status: AuditStatus::Success,
};
```

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::audit::{AuditEvent, AuditStatus};

// Preferred: the constructor, which fills `metadata` with an empty map.
let event = AuditEvent::new(
    "admin-1",
    "user.role.update",
    "user-99",
    None,
    AuditStatus::Success,
);

// …and, where the extra detail is useful:
let event = event.with_metadata("reason", "promoted by support ticket 4412");
```

A struct literal still works if you add `metadata: Default::default()`, but
prefer the constructor — it is the form that survives the next field.

**Automation:** `manual` — this needs a value for a new field (or a switch to
the constructor), which no mechanical rewrite can choose safely.

Also additive, and requiring no change: `AuditSink` gains a **provided**
`purge_before(cutoff, dry_run)` method that defaults to reporting
"unsupported". Existing sinks keep compiling untouched. Override it if your
sink stores audit events somewhere that can be pruned in place and you want
`retention.audit_archives` to reach it — see
[Data Retention for Framework-Owned Data](../guide/data-retention.md).

### openapi: `Parameter` gains a `description` field

**Why:** A `Query<T>` field that decodes as an array of objects
(`?items[0][sku]=A-1`) has no OpenAPI `style` that describes it — neither
RFC 6570 nor OAS 3.x define one. `Parameter` now carries a `description` so
the generated spec names that encoding instead of staying silent about it
(issue #2251).

Only code that constructs a `Parameter` *by struct literal*, outside this
crate, has to change. Every route macro and the OpenAPI generator itself
already build one field at a time and are unaffected.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::openapi::Parameter;

let param = Parameter {
    name: "id".to_owned(),
    location: "path".to_owned(),
    required: true,
    schema: serde_json::json!({ "type": "string" }),
    style: None,
    explode: None,
};
```

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::openapi::Parameter;

let param = Parameter {
    name: "id".to_owned(),
    location: "path".to_owned(),
    required: true,
    schema: serde_json::json!({ "type": "string" }),
    style: None,
    explode: None,
    description: None,
};

// …or, now that `Parameter` derives `Default`:
let param = Parameter {
    name: "id".to_owned(),
    location: "path".to_owned(),
    required: true,
    schema: serde_json::json!({ "type": "string" }),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

**Automation:** `manual` — this needs a value for a new field (or a switch to
`..Default::default()`), which no mechanical rewrite can choose safely.

### SSG: `ManifestEntry` / `StaticManifest` are `#[non_exhaustive]`, and generated pages carry their declared `Content-Type`

**Why:** The static-first serve path used to reverse-engineer each cached page's
`Content-Type` at request time from the route slug and the served file name.
Because every non-root route is stored as `<route>/index.html`, both clues lie,
and the heuristic needed three consecutive corrections during review of #1819.
`autumn build` now records the type each handler declares into
`dist/manifest.json` and the middleware serves it verbatim (issue #1832). The
manifest types were sealed in the same release so a future field cannot break
callers again.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::static_gen::{ManifestEntry, StaticManifest};

let entry = ManifestEntry {
    file: "about/index.html".to_owned(),
    revalidate: Some(3600),
};
let manifest = StaticManifest {
    generated_at: timestamp(),
    autumn_version: "{X.Y.Z}".to_owned(),
    routes,
};
```

**After (`{(X+1).0}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::static_gen::{ManifestEntry, StaticManifest};

let entry = ManifestEntry::new("about/index.html")
    .with_revalidate(Some(3600))
    .with_content_type(Some("text/html; charset=utf-8".to_owned()));
// `new` stamps `generated_at` (Unix-epoch seconds) and `autumn_version` for
// you; chain `.with_generated_at(fixed)` to pin a reproducible timestamp.
let manifest = StaticManifest::new(routes);
```

Exhaustive *destructuring* is sealed too, not just literals — `let
ManifestEntry { file, revalidate } = entry;` now fails with E0638. Add `..` to
the pattern (`let ManifestEntry { file, revalidate, .. } = entry;`) or read the
fields directly.

The on-disk JSON is unaffected in both directions: an existing `dist/` loads
with `content_type` absent and keeps its previous derived types, and a manifest
written by this release still carries every key a pre-#1832 runtime requires, so
a rollback or a rolling deploy sharing one `dist/` volume keeps serving
statically.

**Automation:** `manual` — the rewrite is not a rename or an import move. A
struct literal has to become a constructor call plus a variable number of
`with_*` setters chosen from which fields the literal actually set, and
`StaticManifest::new` *drops* two of the fields the old literal supplied
(stamping them itself), so no purely syntactic rewrite is correct. Both types
are niche (only an app that reads or writes `dist/manifest.json` itself touches
them), so `cargo check` pointing at each E0639/E0063 is enough.

#### Behaviour change: extensionless `#[static_get]` routes returning `String`

Nothing is recorded unless the handler *deliberately* declared a type, so
routes that name their own extension are unaffected: `/theme.css` returning a
`String` still serves `text/css`, because axum's `text/plain; charset=utf-8` is
a default from the return type rather than a statement about the page.

That check is by value, because axum's inferred default and a hand-written
declaration of the same type produce byte-identical responses. Only axum's two
exact spellings are treated as inferred, so if you deliberately want
`text/plain` or `application/octet-stream` on a route whose extension is in
Autumn's asset table, declare it distinctly — bare `text/plain`, or
`application/octet-stream` with a parameter — and it is recorded. Prefer
`Content-Disposition: attachment` for downloads. Extensions outside the asset
table (`.pdf`, `.zip`) always keep the declared type.

An **extensionless** route is the one visible change. `#[static_get("/about")]
async fn about() -> String { html }` has no extension to fall back on, so it is
now served as the `text/plain; charset=utf-8` axum declares, instead of the
`text/html` the old heuristic assumed — the same thing that route already served
on the dynamic path (in dev, or on a manifest miss). Return `Markup` or
`Html<String>` and the page is `text/html` on both paths:

```rust
#[static_get("/about")]
async fn about() -> Markup { html! { h1 { "About" } } }   // text/html
```

For a non-HTML route, declare the type explicitly — this is now the whole
contract, and it is what makes types the old heuristic could never produce
(`application/rss+xml` from `/feed`) work at all:

```rust
#[static_get("/feed")]
async fn feed() -> impl IntoResponse {
    ([(header::CONTENT_TYPE, "application/rss+xml")], build_feed())
}
```

An existing `dist/` records nothing and keeps its previous derived behaviour
until the next `autumn build`.

One operational note: ISR does not rewrite the manifest, so a regeneration whose
handler declares a *different* type than was recorded is refused (logged at
`error`, with the previous page still served) rather than writing bytes the
recorded header would mislabel. Re-run `autumn build` after changing a static
route's `Content-Type`.

### Failure capsules: `capsule::execute` takes `ReplayFixtures`, and the capsule format is version 3

**Why:** Capsules now record every framework effect a failing run produced —
outbound HTTP, job enqueues, cache reads and writes, mail sends, the resolved
tenant, and the random bytes it drew (issue #1634) — and replay serves all of
them from the capsule. A replay is only deterministic if the clock, the entropy
source and the effect tape all come from the *same* capsule, so `execute` takes
one value that bundles them instead of a loose clock.

Two consequences beyond the signature. The document's `format_version` bumps
`2 → 3`, so **capsules recorded by an older Autumn are refused** rather than
replayed with every new seam empty — a reader that tolerated them would report a
verdict on an application shape production never ran. And an outbound HTTP call
during replay is now *served from the capsule* instead of failing closed; a call
the capsule never recorded is still refused, and is reported as a divergence.

**Before:**

```rust
let clock = ReplayClock::new(capsule.clock.clone(), fallback);
let outcome = capsule::execute(router, &capsule, divergences, Some(&clock)).await;
```

**After:**

```rust
let fixtures = ReplayFixtures::from_capsule(&capsule);
// The router is now built *through* the fixtures, so the clock and the
// entropy source it serves come from the same capsule the verdict judges.
let router = TestApp::new()
    .routes(routes![charge])
    .with_clock(fixtures.clock())
    .with_entropy(fixtures.entropy())
    .build()
    .into_router();
let outcome = capsule::execute(router, &capsule, divergences, &fixtures).await;
```

Two smaller source breaks travel with it, both from added fields on
non-`#[non_exhaustive]` types, so only struct-literal construction and
wildcard-less `match`es are affected:

* `ClientError` gains `ReplayedRequestFailure(String)` — a recorded outbound
  transport failure, reproduced as a failure rather than downgraded to a
  status. A `match` on `ClientError` without a `_` arm needs it.
* `Capsule` gains `effects` and `job`, and `ReplayOutcome` gains
  `effect_divergences`. Build capsules with
  `capsule::schema::test_support::capsule(...)` (behind `test-support`) rather
  than a struct literal, or add `..Default::default()`-style fields explicitly.

One behaviour change worth knowing even though it does not break compilation:
during a replay an outbound HTTP call is now **served from the capsule**
instead of failing closed. A call the capsule never recorded is still refused,
and is reported as an effect divergence rather than silently dialling. The
recording answers a call only when its method, URL, caller-set headers *and*
body match — the same endpoint with a different payload is a divergence — and
a mail send is compared against its recorded body as well as its recipients
and subject — and against its sender when the replayed run chose one, since a
message that sets no `from` inherits `[mail] from` at send time and a replay
boots without mail configuration.

Three situations now produce a refusal or an incomplete capsule where an
earlier build would have graded the run. A **job capsule whose payload was
masked** by `[log] filter_parameters` is refused: a handler is handed its
payload verbatim, so it would parse the `[FILTERED]` placeholder rather than
the value production ran on. A run that **enqueued inside its own
transaction** (`enqueue_on_conn`) marks its capsule incomplete, because that
enqueue is also a job-row INSERT on the database tape which replay can serve
but never issue. And an **effect whose future was cancelled** before it
finished — a losing `tokio::select!` branch, a timeout — does the same rather
than persist an outcome the run never had. Each case previously produced a
verdict; each now says why it cannot.

Two API changes come with the sharper failure reproduction. `ClientError` gains
`ReplayedRequestFailure` and `MailError` gains `ReplayedFailure`, both of which
print their recorded text and nothing else; a `match` on either enum without a
`_` arm needs the new variant. Recorded failures are otherwise rebuilt as the
variant production produced, so code branching on
`ClientError::CircuitBreakerOpen` or `MailError::AllRecipientsSuppressed`
behaves during replay as it did live.

A **panicking job** now leaves a capsule on whatever attempt it panicked on.
All three backends dead-letter a panic immediately regardless of remaining
attempts, so a job configured with `max_attempts = 25` that panics on its
first attempt never reaches a "final" one — and under the previous gate never
produced a capsule at all. Ordinary failures are unchanged: still captured on
the final attempt only.

Capsules already on disk are not migrated: replay them with the version that
wrote them, or re-record the failure. A committed regression corpus is
re-recorded and re-converted the same way — `autumn capsule verify` reports
every stale capsule as `UNREADABLE` and exits non-zero, deliberately, so a
corpus cannot quietly stop testing anything. See
[Failure Capsules › Compatibility across Autumn versions](../guide/failure-capsules.md).

**Automation:** `manual` — the new argument is a value the caller has to
construct from the capsule, and there is no textual rewrite that can invent it;
`autumn upgrade` ships no codemod for this. Direct callers of `capsule::execute`
are limited to code that drives replay itself, which is rare outside the
framework.

### Config: `AutumnConfig` gains a `replication` field

**Why:** Continuous SQLite replication (issue #1628) needs its own configuration
section, and `AutumnConfig` has all-public fields with no `#[non_exhaustive]`, so
adding one is a breaking change for anyone constructing the struct literally.
Almost nobody does — `AutumnConfig::default()` and `..Default::default()` are the
documented ways to build one, and both keep compiling.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::config::AutumnConfig;

let config = AutumnConfig {
    server: my_server_config,
    database: my_database_config,
    // …every other field spelled out…
};
```

**After (`{(X+1).0}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::config::AutumnConfig;

let config = AutumnConfig {
    server: my_server_config,
    database: my_database_config,
    ..AutumnConfig::default()
};
```

The new field is `pub replication: Option<Box<ReplicationConfig>>`, `None` by
default, so `..Default::default()` needs no other change. Nothing about an app
that does not configure `[replication]` behaves differently.

**Automation:** `manual` — a struct-literal expression can only be rewritten by
knowing which fields the caller meant to leave defaulted, which a codemod cannot
infer; the fix is the one-line `..AutumnConfig::default()` above.

### Config: `JobConfig` gains a `sqlite` field, and `SchedulerBackend` gains a `Sqlite` variant

**Why:** Durable jobs and a single-host scheduler on SQLite (issue #1907) need
their own configuration. `JobConfig` has all-public fields and `SchedulerBackend`
is not `#[non_exhaustive]`, so both additions are breaking for anyone who
constructs the struct literally or matches the enum exhaustively.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::config::{JobConfig, SchedulerBackend};

let jobs = JobConfig {
    backend: "postgres".to_owned(),
    workers: 4,
    // …every other field spelled out…
};

let label = match config.scheduler.backend {
    SchedulerBackend::InProcess => "single process",
    SchedulerBackend::Postgres => "fleet",
};
```

**After (`{(X+1).0}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::config::{JobConfig, SchedulerBackend};

let jobs = JobConfig {
    backend: "postgres".to_owned(),
    workers: 4,
    ..JobConfig::default()
};

let label = match config.scheduler.backend {
    SchedulerBackend::InProcess => "single process",
    SchedulerBackend::Postgres => "fleet",
    SchedulerBackend::Sqlite => "processes on one host",
    _ => "unknown",
};
```

The new field is `pub sqlite: JobSqliteConfig`, whose `Default` is a 30-second
visibility timeout and a 250ms poll interval, so `..Default::default()` needs no
other change. `SchedulerBackend::Sqlite` reports `is_fleet_distributed() == true`
— it coordinates several processes, on one host.

Nothing changes for an app that keeps `jobs.backend` and `scheduler.backend` as
they are.

**Automation:** `manual` — a struct literal can only be rewritten by knowing
which fields the caller meant to default, and a match arm needs a decision about
what the new variant means for that call site.

### Media rooms: `RoomStore` gains a required `heartbeat` method

Mesh-room participants can now hold a seat with an explicit heartbeat, not only
by polling the roster (see
[the media guide](../guide/media.md)). `autumn_media_plugin::rooms::RoomStore` is
the documented swap seam for a custom room-state backend, so the new operation is
a required trait method with no default body: an out-of-tree `impl RoomStore`
stops compiling until it implements

```rust
fn heartbeat<'a>(
    &'a self,
    namespace: &'a str,
    room_id: &'a str,
    participant_id: &'a str,
    token: &'a str,
    token_ttl: Duration,
) -> RoomStoreFuture<'a, DateTime<Utc>>;
```

It must verify `token` against `participant_id` in constant time and by value,
set that participant's `last_seen_at` to now, renew `token_expires_at` to
`now + token_ttl` **without rotating the token value**, and return the renewed
expiry. Every miss — unknown room, namespace mismatch, unknown participant,
wrong token — returns `RoomError::RoomNotFound`, so a heartbeat cannot probe room
existence or membership. `InMemoryRoomStore` and `DbRoomStore` are the reference
implementations. There is no default body on purpose: a store that silently did
nothing would let the reaper evict live participants.

**Automation:** `manual` — the body depends on how the store holds its state.

### Capacity contracts: three metadata structs gain fields

Deploys can now carry a proven capacity contract (`autumn calibrate` →
`capacity.lock` → `[server] capacity_contract`; see
[the guide](../guide/capacity-contracts.md)). Nothing about existing behaviour
changes — an app that configures no contract sheds exactly as before — but the
feature adds fields to three public, non-`#[non_exhaustive]` structs, so
**struct-literal construction** of them no longer compiles:

* `openapi::ApiDoc` gains `pools: &'static [&'static str]` — the pool tags a
  handler's declared extractors prove it holds.
* `route_listing::RouteInfo` gains `resource_shape: ResourceShape` and
  `pools: Vec<String>`.
* `config::ServerConfig` gains `capacity_contract: Option<String>`.

All three derive `Default`, so the fix is to end the literal with
`..Default::default()` — which is what every construction site inside the
workspace already does, and what the route macros emit. Field access, pattern
matching with a `..` rest, and deserialization of an older routes dump are all
unaffected: the two `RouteInfo` fields are `#[serde(default)]`.

**Automation:** `manual` — `autumn upgrade` ships no codemod for this. The edit
is mechanical (end the literal with `..Default::default()`), but a rewrite
cannot tell an exhaustive struct literal that *wants* to name every field from
one that simply predates these three, and appending a rest pattern to the wrong
literal would silently paper over a genuinely missing value on a later field
addition. Direct struct-literal construction of all three types is rare outside
the framework: `ApiDoc` and `RouteInfo` are macro-emitted, and `ServerConfig` is
normally deserialized from `autumn.toml`.

### Jobs: `JobAdminRecord` gains a `blocked_on_concurrency` field

**Why:** On the Redis backend a job that waits for a free concurrency slot is
parked in a `{prefix}:blocked` zset and promoted back to its queue every
~100 ms. The `/admin/jobs` enqueued tab read the queue lists only, so a parked
job blinked in and out of the table (issue #1186). The tab now lists the queues
and the parked set as one page, and the new field tells the two apart, so the
dashboard can mark a row "waiting on a concurrency slot" instead of showing it
as ready to claim.

`JobAdminRecord` is public and not `#[non_exhaustive]`, so **struct-literal
construction** of it no longer compiles. Only a custom `JobAdminBackend` builds
one; reading a field, and every built-in backend, are unaffected. The built-in
local, Postgres and SQLite backends report `false`: they keep an over-cap job in
`enqueued` status, so it never leaves the tab in the first place.

`JobAdminRecord` now derives `Default`, so the fix is to end the literal with
`..Default::default()` — and that form survives the next field too.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::job::{JobAdminRecord, JobAdminStatus};

let record = JobAdminRecord {
    id: "job-1".to_owned(),
    name: "send_email".to_owned(),
    queue: "default".to_owned(),
    status: JobAdminStatus::Enqueued,
    enqueued_at: None,
    scheduled_for: None,
    started_at: None,
    finished_at: None,
    attempt: 1,
    max_attempts: 5,
    last_error: None,
    principal_id: None,
    correlation_id: None,
};
```

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::job::{JobAdminRecord, JobAdminStatus};

let record = JobAdminRecord {
    id: "job-1".to_owned(),
    name: "send_email".to_owned(),
    queue: "default".to_owned(),
    status: JobAdminStatus::Enqueued,
    attempt: 1,
    max_attempts: 5,
    // Set it to `true` only for a job your backend parks on a full
    // concurrency slot.
    blocked_on_concurrency: false,
    ..Default::default()
};
```

`JobAdminStatus` also derives `Default` now (`Enqueued`), which is what makes
the spread work. Both derives are additive.

**Automation:** `manual` — `autumn upgrade` ships no codemod for this. The edit
is mechanical, but a rewrite cannot tell a literal that means to name every
field from one that simply predates this one, and appending a rest pattern to
the wrong literal would hide a genuinely missing value on a later field
addition.

### Scrub: a `DELETE` trigger or rule on a table `autumn db scrub` empties is refused

`[framework] purge` and `[sample] never_include` both promise a table ends up
empty, and both are enforced by a pass that runs **after** the column rewrites —
it has to, or an audit trigger firing during those rewrites re-fills the table
with the very PII being removed.

The cost is that this pass's own `DELETE`s are the run's last write. An archive
trigger on one of those tables therefore fires after every rewrite, and can copy
the rows it is removing into an ordinary classified table that has already been
scrubbed — leaving real values in a table the run reports as clean, and in any
`--output` artifact taken from it.

No ordering avoids this: the trigger graph decides where each write lands, and
it can be cyclic. No postcondition catches it either, because a trigger body can
write anywhere the scrub never looks. So the run refuses before writing
anything, `--check` and `--dry-run` included:

```text
✗ 1 table(s) this run empties carry a user-defined trigger or rewrite rule that fires on `DELETE`:
    - audit_logs
```

**Who is affected.** Only a target whose purged or `never_include` tables carry
a user-defined `DELETE` trigger or an `ON DELETE` rewrite rule that can fire — a
trigger declared on a leaf partition of such a table counts, since
`DELETE FROM parent` fires it, while a rule does not, because a rule fires only
on the relation the statement names. `INSERT`/`UPDATE`-only triggers are
unaffected and still merely warn, a trigger or rule disabled with
`ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER` / `ALTER RULE` does not count, and a target
with neither behaves exactly as before. This reaches an unsampled
`autumn db scrub` too, wherever `[framework] purge` names a table with one.

A session already running under `session_replication_role = replica` is refused
separately and for the same reason: that setting inverts which triggers fire, so
the set the run inspected is not the set that would run.

**The fix.** Drop or disable the trigger on the copy before scrubbing — which is
already the advice the scrub's trigger warning gives:

```sql
ALTER TABLE audit_logs DISABLE TRIGGER audit_archive;
-- or, for a rewrite rule
DROP RULE audit_archive ON audit_logs;
```

Scrub a restored copy rather than a live database, and this costs nothing: the
trigger exists for the production system's audit trail, which the copy does not
need.

**Automation:** `manual` — `autumn upgrade` ships no codemod for this, and could
not: the change is a refusal against the shape of the *target database*, not
against anything in your source tree, so there is no code for a rewrite to find.
Whether a given trigger may be dropped on the copy is a judgement about that
copy's purpose, and the refusal names the exact tables when it fires.

### ACME: `AcmeRenewalTask` gains `dns` and `recovery`, `AcmeConfig` gains `dns`

Wildcard certificates over the DNS-01 challenge
([the guide](../guide/tls.md#wildcard-certificates-via-dns-01-servertlsacmedns))
add two fields to `acme::renewal::AcmeRenewalTask` and one to
`config::AcmeConfig`. Everything here is behind the off-by-default `acme`
feature, and an app that configures no `[server.tls.acme.dns]` section behaves
exactly as before — HTTP-01, unchanged.

* `AcmeRenewalTask::dns: Option<acme::renewal::DnsChallenge>` — the DNS-01
  wiring. `None` keeps issuance on the HTTP-01 path.
* `AcmeRenewalTask::recovery: Option<acme::renewal::RecoveryFn>` — invoked after
  an issuance that succeeded following a recorded failure, so the app can clear
  the operator alert its reporter raised.
* `AcmeConfig::dns: Option<config::AcmeDnsConfig>` — the deserialized
  `[server.tls.acme.dns]` section.

Only **struct-literal construction** is affected, which in practice means test
harnesses: the framework builds `AcmeRenewalTask` itself, and `AcmeConfig` is
deserialized from `autumn.toml`. Neither type derives `Default`, so the fix is
to name the fields.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
let task = AcmeRenewalTask {
    resolver,
    provider,
    store,
    cert_id,
    tokens,
    status,
    config,
    serving_stored_cert: false,
    leadership_degraded: false,
    renew_window_misconfigured: AtomicBool::new(false),
};
```

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```rust
let task = AcmeRenewalTask {
    // …unchanged fields…
    renew_window_misconfigured: AtomicBool::new(false),
    dns: None,      // Some(DnsChallenge { .. }) to issue over DNS-01
    recovery: None, // Some(callback) to clear an operator alert on recovery
};
```

The new **output** types in `acme::dns` — the parsed DNS answer, its records,
the propagation-timeout detail, the credential, and the HTTP request/response —
are `#[non_exhaustive]` from the start, so fields can be added to those without
a break. `AcmeConfig`, `AcmeDnsConfig`, `AcmeRenewalTask` and `DnsChallenge`
deliberately are not: callers construct them by struct literal and they have no constructor, so
sealing them would make them unbuildable outside this crate. That is the same
trade-off `config::ServerConfig` makes.

**Automation:** `manual` — `autumn upgrade` ships no codemod. The edit is two
lines in a test harness, and a rewrite cannot tell an `AcmeRenewalTask` literal
that means "HTTP-01" from one whose author intended to configure DNS-01;
defaulting to `None` silently would be right in the first case and wrong in the
second, which is exactly the choice a human should make.

### Authorize: aliased `#[authorize]` and ambiguous attribute shapes are now a compile error

**Why:** A security review (🛡 Warden) found that `#[authorize]` reached
through `use ::autumn_web::authorize as x;` was invisible to the
macro-expansion-time checks that decide who serves a cached
`.idempotent()` reply — because a proc-macro attribute only ever sees the
tokens of the item it annotates, never the enclosing module's `use`
declarations. That let an idempotency-replay cache serve a stale "allowed"
response after the requester's authorization was revoked, skipping
`#[authorize]`'s policy re-check entirely. A syntactic heuristic (detecting
`#[authorize]` by its argument *shape* instead of its literal name) was
tried and found unsafe in the *other* direction during review: it could
misclassify an unrelated attribute that happens to share the same argument
grammar, silently breaking `.idempotent()`'s dedup guarantee instead. No
heuristic can resolve the ambiguity correctly in both directions, so Autumn
now refuses to compile it.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::authorize as authz; // or any other alias

#[autumn_web::post("/notes/{id}")]
#[authz("update", resource = Note)]
async fn update_note(note: Note) -> AutumnResult<&'static str> {
    // ...
}
```

This compiled — and, with `AppBuilder::idempotent()` turned on, was
vulnerable to the stale-replay bypass above.

This refusal fires when the aliased or shape-alike attribute is still
present, unexpanded, at the point a route/guard macro (`#[post]`,
`#[secured]`, `#[step_up]`, `#[throttle]`, `#[feature_flag]`) expands and
scans for it — which is always true for the documented, natural attribute
order shown above (`#[post(...)]` above `#[authz(...)]`, so `#[post]`
expands first and sees the alias still raw below it). Written the other way
around — the aliased or shape-alike attribute *above* the route macro — it
expands first on its own and is gone from the attribute list by the time
any Autumn macro runs, so this specific refusal never fires for it. That
ordering doesn't reopen a gap, though: a genuine aliased `#[authorize]`
positioned there still runs for real and leaves its own recognizable
in-body check, which every route/guard macro's fallback body-scan already
detects (the same mechanism that makes a *literal* `#[authorize]` above
`#[post]` work correctly); an unrelated, non-Autumn attribute positioned
there just expands as whatever it actually is and leaves nothing
authorize-shaped behind, so the route is correctly treated as unguarded
rather than falsely protected.

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::authorize; // spell it by its real name — no alias

#[autumn_web::post("/notes/{id}")]
#[authorize("update", resource = Note)]
async fn update_note(note: Note) -> AutumnResult<&'static str> {
    // ...
}
```

`#[authorize]` used under its literal name and applied unconditionally,
exactly as every other Autumn macro normally is, is unaffected — this only
closes the alias case. This includes a literal `#[authorize(...)]` reached
through `#[cfg_attr(predicate, authorize(...))]`: the compiler resolves
`cfg_attr` before Autumn's route/guard macros ever see the attribute, so it
behaves exactly like any other `cfg_attr`-conditional attribute (fully
present or fully absent depending on the predicate, decided by the
compiler, not guessed at by a macro) — nothing new to migrate there. An
*aliased* name behind `cfg_attr` is still caught by this same change, since
by the time it reaches Autumn's ambiguity check the wrapper is already gone
and it's indistinguishable from an ordinary aliased `#[authorize]`.

If instead the compile error fires on an attribute that is genuinely
**not** `#[authorize]` (a custom or third-party attribute that happens to
share its `"action", resource = Type[, from = ident]` argument grammar —
an `#[audit("update", resource = Note)]`, say), rename that attribute so
its shape no longer collides. Autumn cannot tell the two cases apart from
tokens alone, which is exactly why it refuses both rather than guessing.

**Automation:** `manual` — the fix is a `use` statement and an attribute
spelling change, or renaming an unrelated attribute, which depends on which
of the two cases above applies; no mechanical rewrite can tell them apart.
See
[`docs/security/2026-09-08-aliased-authorize-idempotency-bypass/`](../security/2026-09-08-aliased-authorize-idempotency-bypass/README.md)
for the full threat model and review history.

### static_get: `#[feature_flag]` is now a compile error

**Why:** Found while reviewing the `#[authorize]` fix above. A
`#[static_get]` route's cache hits are served by the static-first
middleware before the inner router — and the handler along with it — is
ever reached, which is exactly why `#[secured]`/`#[step_up]`/`#[throttle]`/
`#[authorize]` are already refused in combination with it (see
`static_route.rs`'s existing `INCOMPATIBLE_GUARD_MSG`). `#[feature_flag]`'s
pre-body gate has the identical shape but was never added to that refusal,
so a `#[feature_flag]`-gated `#[static_get]` route compiled successfully
while silently not working the way it looked: once a page was cached, a
later-disabled flag no longer hid it — the cache kept serving the
pre-rendered content regardless of the flag's live value.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
#[autumn_web::static_get("/beta-page")]
#[autumn_web::feature_flag("beta_page")]
async fn beta_page() -> &'static str {
    "..."
}
```

This compiled, and pre-rendered/cached the page at build time; disabling
`beta_page` afterward did not stop the cached page from being served.

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```rust
use autumn_web::feature_flags::{FeatureFlagService, InMemoryFlagStore};
use axum::{extract::{Request, State}, http::StatusCode, middleware::Next, response::Response};
use std::sync::Arc;

// AppBuilder::static_gate runs a Tower/axum layer before a cache hit, so
// -- unlike a #[feature_flag] attribute on the handler -- it can actually
// gate a pre-rendered page. It runs outside the app's own router, before
// AppState exists, so the flag service can't be pulled from there the way
// #[feature_flag]'s extractor does -- construct and share it explicitly
// instead, and register the *same* store with the app via
// `.with_flag_store(...)` so both see the same flag state.
async fn beta_page_gate(
    State(flags): State<FeatureFlagService>,
    req: Request,
    next: Next,
) -> Response {
    if req.uri().path() == "/beta-page" && !flags.is_enabled("beta_page", None) {
        return Response::builder()
            .status(StatusCode::NOT_FOUND)
            .body(axum::body::Body::empty())
            .unwrap();
    }
    next.run(req).await
}

let store = Arc::new(InMemoryFlagStore::new());
let flags = FeatureFlagService::new(store.clone());

let app = autumn_web::app()
    .static_gate(axum::middleware::from_fn_with_state(flags, beta_page_gate))
    .with_flag_store(store);

#[autumn_web::static_get("/beta-page")]
async fn beta_page() -> &'static str {
    "..."
}
```

**Automation:** `manual` — moving the gate from an attribute to
`AppBuilder::static_gate` is a structural change no codemod can make safely
(it needs the app's `AppBuilder` chain, not just the handler function).

### Lifecycle: an unsound `#[lifecycle]` graph is now a compile error

**Why:** `#[lifecycle]` proved its *endpoints* — every `initial`, `terminal` and
transition endpoint is a real variant, and a terminal has no outgoing edge — but
never the shape of the graph those edges form. Two structural faults still
compiled: a state unreachable from `initial`, which no machine can ever enter,
and a reachable non-terminal state with no path to a terminal, which traps a
machine that enters it.

`autumn lifecycle check` reported both, but it scans source rather than
resolving it: a `#[lifecycle]` reached through a cross-file alias or a glob
re-export is skipped (#1925), so an unsound lifecycle spelled that way passed
the gate and shipped. The macro sees every declaration however it is spelled, so
the proof belongs there.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
#[lifecycle(
    initial = Pending,
    terminal(Delivered),
    transitions(
        Pending -> OnHold,
        Pending -> Paid,
        Paid -> Delivered,
    )
)]
pub enum OrderState {
    Pending,
    OnHold,     // reachable, non-terminal, no way out
    Paid,
    Delivered,
    Refunded,   // no transition targets it
}
```

This compiled. `autumn lifecycle check` failed on it — unless the attribute was
spelled through a cross-file alias, in which case nothing caught it.

**After (`{X.Z}`):**

```text
error: state `Refunded` is unreachable from initial state `Pending` of lifecycle `OrderState` — add a transition into it, or remove the variant
error: state `OnHold` is a non-terminal dead-end of lifecycle `OrderState`: no declared transition path reaches a terminal state — add an outgoing transition, or declare it terminal
```

Fix each named state one of three ways: add the missing transition, drop the
variant, or declare the state terminal.

**One case needs a different fix.** An enum bound to a persisted column with
`#[state_machine(lifecycle = <Enum>)]` may carry a state that exists only as an
*entry* state for created rows — an `Imported` or `Migrated` value no edge
targets. `#[lifecycle]` declares one entry point, `initial`, so such a state now
reads as unreachable. Either give it an edge from `initial`, or drop
`#[lifecycle]` for that field and declare the table inline with
`#[state_machine(transitions(...))]`, which is runtime-checked and applies no
reachability rule. See
[Declarative State Machines](../guide/state-machines.md).

**Automation:** `manual` — the fix depends on which state the author meant to be
reachable, which no codemod can infer.

### OpenApiSchema: `#[serde(skip_serializing_if)]` now needs `#[serde(default)]`

**Why:** `skip_serializing_if` governs serialization alone — a response may omit
the field, while serde still rejects a *request* that omits it. The derive used
to accept the attribute whenever the field was spelled `Option<T>`, treating
that as proof omission is valid on the way in. It is only proof for `std`'s
`Option`, and a proc macro cannot tell: it sees the tokens as written, so an
application's own type named `Option` reads identically and *is* required on the
way in. For such a type neither answer is right — marking the property
`required` lets a response omit what the schema demands, marking it optional
lets a client omit what serde rejects — so the shape is refused rather than
guessed. `#[serde(default)]` is what actually makes omission valid in both
directions, and it is a no-op on a real `Option<T>`, which serde already fills
with `None` when the field is missing.

**Before (`0.7`):**

```rust
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize, autumn_web::openapi::OpenApiSchema)]
struct Profile {
    name: String,
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    nickname: Option<String>,
}
```

**After (`0.8`):**

```rust
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize, autumn_web::openapi::OpenApiSchema)]
struct Profile {
    name: String,
    #[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    nickname: Option<String>,
}
```

**Automation:** `manual` — the fix is one attribute, but deciding it is the
right fix is not mechanical. On a genuine `Option<T>` adding `#[serde(default)]`
changes nothing and is always correct; on any other type it changes what serde
accepts, so a codemod that added it everywhere would silently widen a request
contract. `#[model]` is unaffected: its read schema describes a response only,
so a conditionally-skipped column there stays sound without the attribute.

## Plugin authors

This release **adds** plugin-facing surface and removes none, so no plugin that
compiles today stops compiling. Two things do change for you: `autumn
plugin-check` gains a check your plugin has to satisfy (see the end of this
section), and `ConformanceConfig` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.

See [`docs/plugins.md`](../plugins.md#the-plugin-api-contract) for the full
contract and [`STABILITY.md`](../../STABILITY.md#the-plugin-api-surface-issue-1601)
for the policy.

- **Stable surface changed:** one, and only for a construction style nothing
  in this repository used. **Breaking:** `plugin_conformance::ConformanceConfig`
  gains a `contract` field and is now `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a struct literal
  (`ConformanceConfig { plugin_name, expected_prefix, .. }`) no longer compiles.
  Build it the documented way instead — the fluent constructors are unchanged:

  ```rust,ignore
  let config = ConformanceConfig::new("autumn-plugin-mine")
      .prefix("/mine")
      .sensitive_route("/mine", "Role: admin required");
  ```

  `#[non_exhaustive]` lands with the field on purpose: it is what lets a later
  release add a check's configuration without doing this to you twice. See the
  [migration guide](next.md).

  Nothing else was removed, renamed, or re-signatured. The surface that already
  existed is now *declared* stable in
  `autumn_web::plugin_contract::PLUGIN_SURFACES` and compiled on every commit by
  the pinned `autumn-plugin-reference` crate.
- **Experimental surface changed:** none. `AppBuilder::with_edge_kv` and
  `autumn_edge::host` are now labelled experimental, matching what
  `STABILITY.md` already said about the edge capsule lane (issue #1790).
- **New stable surface:**
  - `Plugin::contract` — declare the `autumn-web` range your plugin supports.
    Defaults to `None`, so implementing it is optional.
  - `autumn_web::plugin_contract` — `PluginContract`, `PLUGIN_SURFACES`,
    `SurfaceTier`, `evaluate`, `lockstep_range`, `lockstep_contract`, and the
    `PLUGIN_CONTRACT_MARKER` dump protocol.
  - `AppBuilder::plugin_contracts()` — the contracts declared by the plugins
    mounted on a builder.
  - `ConformanceConfig::contract(...)` and
    `plugin_conformance::check_experimental_surface(...)` — the
    `experimental-surface` check, runnable from your own test suite.
  - `autumn_web::db::Pool` and `autumn_web::reexports::diesel_migrations` — so a
    plugin implementing `DatabasePoolProvider` or shipping migrations through
    `AppBuilder::plugin_migrations` can name what those seams need without
    taking its own `diesel-async` / `diesel-migrations` dependency. (Both were
    found by writing the reference plugin: the seams were declared plugin-facing
    and were not reachable from stable API.)
- **Declared range to move to:** `autumn-web {X.Y}` — add
  `.autumn_web("{X.Y}")` to your `Plugin::contract` and re-run
  `autumn plugin-check --plugin-name <your-plugin>`. A plugin that releases in
  lockstep with the framework can write
  `.autumn_web(lockstep_range(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")))` instead and never
  touch the literal again — or write the whole `Plugin::contract` body in one
  call with the new `lockstep_contract(env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME"),
  env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))`, which every first-party plugin in this
  repository now does (previously each wrote out the three-call construction
  by hand).

**Breaking for the `plugin-check` command, and only for it.** Two checks join
the report. `plugin-contract` **fails** when the plugin under check declares no
usable `autumn-web` range; `experimental-surface` reports what the plugin
declares and fails only on a name that cannot be resolved against the registry.

So: your plugin still *compiles and runs* unchanged whether or not it declares
a contract — that part is genuinely additive. But if your CI runs
`autumn plugin-check --plugin-name <your-plugin>`, it goes red until you
implement `Plugin::contract`. That is deliberate: this is the author-facing
gate, and "you have not said which framework versions you support" is exactly
what it exists to say. Implementing the four-line `contract()` above clears it.

Both checks **skip** against a host binary built on an `autumn-web` that
predates the contract dump, so an older host app does not turn them red — but
`--deny-experimental` fails closed in that case rather than silently passing,
because a flag that forbids something must not quietly become a no-op.

`autumn generate plugin` now scaffolds `Plugin::contract` and a conformance
test that passes it, so a freshly generated plugin is green out of the box.

## Compiler error cheat sheet

Paste the most common errors a user will hit and the fix. This is the
single most valuable section of the guide — keep it factual and short.

| Error message (truncated) | Where you see it | Fix |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----|
| `error[E0432]: unresolved import \`autumn_web::foo\`` | module reorganized | `use autumn_web::<new path>;` |
| `error[E0061]: this function takes 2 arguments but 1 was supplied` | `App::run` added a parameter | see [Breaking changes › {Area}] |

## Configuration changes

**New `[server.tls.client_auth]` section** (additive; absent means the listener
requests no client certificate, exactly as before). It turns #1603's TLS
listener into a mutual-TLS one, verifying the caller against a PEM bundle of
client CAs:

```toml
[server.tls.client_auth]
mode           = "required"                          # off (default) | optional | required
ca_bundle_path = "/etc/autumn/tls/client-ca.pem"     # one or more PEM CAs
crl_path       = "/etc/autumn/tls/client-ca.crl.pem" # optional revocation list
required_paths = ["/internal/"]                      # routes that demand a certificate
```

Startup fails, naming the path, when the bundle or CRL is missing, unparseable
or empty; when `mode` is not `off` and no `ca_bundle_path` is set; and when
`required_paths` is non-empty under `mode = "off"` (those routes would reject
every request). Like the sibling `[server.tls.acme]` table, these keys have no
`AUTUMN_SERVER__TLS__*` environment override. See the
[TLS guide](../guide/tls.md#mutual-tls-verifying-client-certificates-servertlsclient_auth).

**New `[server.tls.acme.dns]` section** (additive; absent means HTTP-01, exactly
as before). It names a DNS provider and the *credentials-store key* holding that
provider's API credential — never the credential itself. The section is
`deny_unknown_fields`, so an `api_token = "..."` written into `autumn.toml` is a
startup error naming the key rather than a plaintext secret nobody notices:

```toml
[server.tls.acme]
domains = ["myapp.com", "*.myapp.com"]   # a wildcard is now accepted…
contact_email = "ops@myapp.com"

[server.tls.acme.dns]                    # …when this section is present
provider = "cloudflare"                  # cloudflare | route53 | exec
```

A wildcard entry in `[server.tls.acme] domains` is rejected at startup **unless**
this section is configured, because no CA validates a wildcard identifier over
HTTP-01.

**New environment variables**, which override the encrypted credentials store
field for field:

| Variable | Field |
|---|---|
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_API_TOKEN` | `api_token` (Cloudflare) |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `access_key_id` (Route 53) |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `secret_access_key` (Route 53) |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_SESSION_TOKEN` | `session_token` (Route 53) |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` | `hosted_zone_id` (Route 53) |
| `AUTUMN_ACME_DNS_REGION` | `region` (Route 53) |

### New: `[replication]` (continuous SQLite replication)

Optional and off by default; an app that does not add the section is unaffected.
Every key has an `AUTUMN_REPLICATION__*` environment override, and credentials
are named by environment variable rather than inlined — the same posture as
`[backup.offsite]`. See
[SQLite in production → Durability](../guide/sqlite-in-production.md#durability-continuous-replication-and-point-in-time-restore).

When `[replication] enabled = true`, pooled SQLite connections are created with
`PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 0` so the replicator is the only component that
checkpoints. That is a deliberate behaviour change for replicating apps and is
described in the guide; apps without the section keep SQLite's default
auto-checkpointing.

### New: `[jobs.sqlite]` (durable SQLite job queue)

Read only when `jobs.backend = "sqlite"`; every other backend ignores it. Two
keys, both with `AUTUMN_JOBS__SQLITE__*` environment overrides:
`visibility_timeout_ms` (default 30 000) bounds how long a claim a crashed
worker left behind stays unreclaimed, and `poll_interval_ms` (default 250) sets
how fast an idle worker sees work another process enqueued. See
[SQLite in production → Durable jobs without Redis](../guide/sqlite-in-production.md#durable-jobs-without-redis).

`scheduler.backend = "sqlite"` needs no new section: it reuses
`scheduler.lease_ttl_secs` and `scheduler.key_prefix`.

## Behavior changes

### HTTPS: the listener's connect-info type changed (#1640)

Only the **in-process TLS listener** (`[server.tls]`) is affected; the plain-TCP
and Unix-socket paths are untouched.

The HTTPS serve arm now hands axum a `TlsConnectInfo` (peer address plus the
verified client identity, when there is one) instead of a bare `SocketAddr`, and
a new framework layer immediately re-stamps `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` from it.
So `ClientAddr`, trusted-proxy resolution, IP-keyed rate limiting, SSE and
`wss://` all behave exactly as before, and a handler extracting
`ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` keeps compiling and keeps resolving the real peer.

One case needs a change: a handler that extracted the HTTPS connect-info by some
other route — say a custom layer reading `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` *outside* the
framework stack, or a test that wires `axum::serve` over
`autumn_web::tls::TlsListener` by hand. Wire such a test the way the framework
does:

```rust
use autumn_web::tls::{TlsConnectInfo, client_auth::ClientIdentityLayer};

let service = tower::Layer::layer(&ClientIdentityLayer, router);
let make_service =
    axum::ServiceExt::<axum::extract::Request>::into_make_service_with_connect_info::<
        TlsConnectInfo,
    >(service);
```

The previous `listener.tap_io(|_io| {})` wrapper is no longer needed.

### CI: `autumn upgrade` adds a blocking dependency audit — add `deny.toml` with it

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is framework-owned, so `autumn upgrade --apply`
reconciles it and your project picks up the new dependency-advisory gate
(issue #1600): it runs `cargo deny check advisories` on every push and fails
the build on a known RustSec advisory.

That audit reads a `deny.toml` at your project root, which `autumn new` writes
for new projects and the upgrade deliberately does **not** create — its waiver
list is yours, and a file you are asked to edit must never come back as an
upgrade conflict. Add it in the same commit as the upgrade:

Generate a throwaway project with the release you are upgrading to, **using the
same flags you originally scaffolded with**, and copy its policy in. The flags
matter: `--bundled-pg` apps pull the embedded-Postgres build stack, so their
policy carries a second waiver (`RUSTSEC-2024-0384`, `instant`) that other
flavors deliberately do not ship. A donor generated without your flags installs
a policy that fails your first audit.

```bash
cd /tmp
autumn new policy-donor          # add your original flags here, e.g. --bundled-pg
cd -
cp /tmp/policy-donor/deny.toml ./deny.toml
rm -rf /tmp/policy-donor
git add deny.toml
```

Without it the audit step stops before auditing and tells you exactly this —
it does not fall back to an unwaived default policy and fail on an advisory
Autumn has already triaged (`rsa`/RUSTSEC-2023-0071, which reaches every
Autumn app through `jsonwebtoken` and has no patched release).

Then read [the advisory gate](../guide/supply-chain.md#part-3a--the-advisory-gate-known-vulnerable-dependencies)
for how to read a failure and how to waive an advisory. Never disable the step
to get green: an edited `ci.yml` becomes a conflict on every later upgrade.

Other changes that still compile but behave differently at runtime. Examples:

- Error responses adopted a new JSON shape.
- A default middleware is now ordered differently.
- A scheduled task now runs on a different worker.

## Deprecations retained from `{X.Y}`

Items that were deprecated during the `{X.Y}` line and have now been
removed. Link each to the release where the deprecation notice first
appeared so users can see how much warning they had.

### Config-key removals

Config keys removed in this major release were registered in
`DEPRECATED_CONFIG_KEYS` (`autumn/src/config.rs`) with `remove_in = "{X+1}.0.0"`.
Startup issued a `WARN` log entry for each deprecated key detected in the config
(via `since = "{X.Y}"`), and `autumn doctor` surfaced them in the
`deprecated_keys` check.

For each removed config key, fill in the table below:

| Removed key (TOML / env var) | Replacement | Deprecated since | References |
|------------------------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| `section.old_key` / `AUTUMN_SECTION__OLD_KEY` | `section.new_key` | `{X.Y}.0` | (link to changelog) |

If no config keys were removed, delete this subsection.

## Upstream dependency updates

For each major dependency bump carried with this release:

- Link to that project's upstream migration notes.
- Call out any of their changes that leak through Autumn's public API.

If no majors were carried, delete this section.

## How to verify

The reader's proof the upgrade landed. Keep it to concrete, checkable steps —
commands with expected output, not "make sure everything works". Required by
`scripts/check-migration-guides.sh`.

1. `cargo check` — clean, with none of the errors in the cheat sheet above.
2. `cargo test` — the suite is green on the new version.
3. `autumn doctor --strict` — no findings.
4. {one step per breaking change: the observable behaviour that proves the fix
   was applied, e.g. "hit `/x` and confirm the response carries `Y`"}

### Guide-only upgrade walkthrough

(The heading keeps its historical name; the walk-through itself is
codemod-first.) Upgrade an app scaffolded with `autumn new` on the **previous** release
**codemod-first** — `autumn upgrade` before any manual step — using only this
guide for what remains, and record the result here before publishing to
crates.io. See [`docs/release-checklist.md`](../release-checklist.md),
*Migration Guide Gate*.

- **Codemod:** {the `autumn upgrade` invocation the walk-through ran first, and
  what it covered. Required once this release ships any `auto`/`review`
  codemod; the remaining manual steps below must be only the `review`/`manual`
  changes.}
- **Status:** pending
  {the value must *begin* with `performed YYYY-MM-DD` once the walk-through is
  done, or `backfilled` for a guide written after its release shipped;
  `pending` is accepted only while this file is still `next.md`}
- **From → to:** `autumn-cli {X.Y.Z}` app upgraded to `autumn-web {X.Z.0}`
- **Elapsed:** {minutes — the budget is under 30 for a guide-only
  walk-through, and under 10 once `autumn upgrade` covers this release's
  rename-level changes (issue #1629)}
- **Gaps found and fixed in this guide:** {none, or what the walk-through
  exposed}

## Troubleshooting

Known rough edges, workarounds, and known-good version combinations
(e.g. "use `diesel 2.2.5+` — earlier `2.2.x` releases have a known
`pq-sys` linkage issue on macOS").

## Reporting problems

If you hit something not covered here, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues> with:

- The error message or unexpected behavior.
- The old version you upgraded from.
- A minimal reproduction if possible.

Migration guides are living documents — we update them based on user
reports for the first few months after a major release.
