# Autumn Release Checklist

This document is the canonical pre-publish checklist for every Autumn release.
It records the crates we publish, the required publication order, the version
compatibility rule for each crate, and the automated gates that must pass before
a tag triggers a GitHub Release.

See also [`STABILITY.md`](../STABILITY.md) for the full stability policy and
SemVer contract.

## Published Crates

| Crate | Directory | Publish Order | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `autumn-macros-support` | `autumn-macros-support/` | 1 | No Autumn runtime deps. Every macro crate pins it, so it must publish first. |
| `autumn-macros` | `autumn-macros/` | 2 | Depends on `autumn-macros-support`. |
| `autumn-macros-model` | `autumn-macros-model/` | 2 | Depends on `autumn-macros-support`. `autumn-web` pins it **optionally**, so it must precede `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-macros-repository` | `autumn-macros-repository/` | 2 | Depends on `autumn-macros-support`. `autumn-web` pins it **optionally**, so it must precede `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-schema-core` | `autumn-schema-core/` | 3 | No Autumn runtime deps. `autumn-cli` pins it. |
| `autumn-edge` | `autumn-edge/` | 4 | Depends on `autumn-macros`. `autumn-web` pins it — **optionally**, but cargo still requires an optional dependency to resolve on crates.io, so it must precede `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-web` | `autumn/` | 5 | Depends on `autumn-macros`, the two macro shards and `autumn-edge`. |
| `autumn-cli` | `autumn-cli/` | 6 | Depends on `autumn-schema-core`. Independent of `autumn-web` at crate level. |
| `autumn-admin-plugin` | `autumn-admin-plugin/` | 7 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-media-plugin` | `autumn-media-plugin/` | 7 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-storage-s3` | `autumn-storage-s3/` | 7 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-cache-redis` | `autumn-cache-redis/` | 7 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-search` | `autumn-search/` | 7 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-billing` | `autumn-billing/` | 7 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |

This table is the same set, in the same order, as `CRATES` in
[`scripts/check-publish-dry-run.sh`](../scripts/check-publish-dry-run.sh) —
that script is the executable copy, so keep the two in step. Note that two
other gate scripts currently carry **narrower** lists —
`scripts/check-crate-metadata.sh` omits `autumn-schema-core` and
`autumn-media-plugin`, and `scripts/check-semver.sh` omits all four of
`autumn-schema-core`, `autumn-edge`, `autumn-media-plugin` and `autumn-billing`
(the last has no published baseline yet). Those crates are
therefore published without a metadata or SemVer check today; widening both
lists is worth doing, but it does not change the publish order above. The
three crates the macro split added (#2809) are in all four lists, because a
crate `autumn-web` pins by version has to publish, and an unchecked new crate
is the one most likely to publish wrong.

All crates share a single workspace version (`[workspace.package].version` in
`Cargo.toml`). They are always released together at the same version.

### Version Compatibility Rules

- Every crate's `version` field inherits from `[workspace.package].version`.
- Crates that depend on other published Autumn crates pin the **exact workspace
  version** (e.g. `autumn-web = { version = "X.Y.Z", ... }`). A workspace
  version bump must update these pins in lockstep.
- The `[patch.crates-io]` override in the root `Cargo.toml` redirects
  `autumn-web` to the local workspace path during development. **Remove or
  comment this section** if you ever need to test against a published version
  locally.

## Autumn Harvest Compatibility Boundary

[Autumn Harvest](https://github.com/madmax983/autumn-harvest) is a companion
repository that provides starter templates, the scaffold generator registry, and
generated application CI. It is maintained on its own release train.

**Checks that belong in this repo:**

- Autumn framework crate packaging, docs.rs build, and SemVer gate.
- CLI commands shipped by `autumn-cli`.
- Generated application smoke test (see [Downstream Smoke Test](#6--downstream-smoke-test-smoke-job)).

**Checks that belong in the Harvest repo:**

- Template rendering correctness and starter project CI.
- Harvest-specific CLI flags and template version pins.
- Integration tests that use the Harvest template registry API.

When an Autumn release changes the generated-app contract (config schema,
generated file structure, CLI flags), open a companion PR in the Harvest repo
before tagging the Autumn release.

---

## Supply Chain: SBOM and Provenance

Every tagged release attaches a CycloneDX SBOM (`autumn-<tag>.cdx.json`), and
every release asset — the SBOM and each CLI archive with its `.sha256` — carries
a keyless SLSA build-provenance attestation tied to the commit and CI run that
produced it.

- The `sbom` gate job (`scripts/check-sbom.sh`) generates the SBOM with the CLI
  from the checkout being released, regenerates it and compares
  component-by-component, and requires its root component version to equal both
  `[workspace.package].version` and the pushed tag. The verified file is handed
  to `prepare-release` as an artifact, so what ships is exactly what passed.
- Attestations are published by `release.yml` and `cli-release.yml`, which need
  `id-token: write` + `attestations: write`. Both attest **before** uploading,
  so an attestation failure stops the release rather than leaving unattested
  assets on a live one.

Consumers verify with one command; the full walkthrough, including the
negative (tampered-asset) case, is in
[docs/guide/supply-chain.md](guide/supply-chain.md):

```bash
gh attestation verify autumn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
  --repo autumn-foundation/autumn
```

Run the gate locally before tagging:

```bash
RELEASE_TAG=v0.8.0 ./scripts/check-sbom.sh
```

### Dependency advisories

A release must not ship a known-vulnerable dependency. `scripts/check-advisories.sh`
runs in both PR CI and the Publish Gate (`advisories` job, a `prepare-release`
dependency), auditing five graphs against the RustSec database with cargo-deny:

- the workspace (`deny.toml`) and the SQLite backend graph (`deny-sqlite.toml`);
- **the scaffold's day-one graph** — `autumn-web`'s tree with every feature any
  scaffold flavor can enable, audited with the `deny.toml` that `autumn new`
  writes into a generated app. That is a superset of the autumn-web half of a
  real app's tree (not its own direct dependencies, and resolved against this
  workspace's lockfile), and it is what keeps "a scaffolded app's CI is green on
  day one" true release over release rather than a claim that decays;
- **two satellite graphs**, each its own excluded workspace root with its own
  `Cargo.lock` and its own narrower `deny.toml` (advisories + sources only):
  `fuzz/` (compiled and run by every `fuzz.yml` CI job) and
  `examples/island-flock/` (never built in CI, but its compiled wasm/js bundle
  is committed and served by the `flock` example).

An advisory with no fix is accepted by adding an `ignore` entry (id, `reason`,
review-by date) — never by weakening or removing the gate. `--self-test` proves
the gate can still go red by auditing an injected known-vulnerable dependency.

```bash
./scripts/check-advisories.sh              # the gate, all five graphs
./scripts/check-advisories.sh --self-test  # the negative proof
```

---

## Automated Gates (`publish-gate` Workflow)

The `.github/workflows/publish-gate.yml` workflow runs these jobs. Each must
pass before the release is announced.

### 1 · Crate Metadata (`metadata` job)

Script: `scripts/check-crate-metadata.sh`

Fails if any publishable crate is missing:

- `description`, `homepage`, `repository`, `readme`, `license`,
  `keywords`, `categories`, `rust-version`
- The `readme` file referenced in the manifest actually exists on disk.

### 2 · Package Dry-Run (`package` job)

Script: `scripts/check-publish-dry-run.sh`

Runs `cargo package -p <crate> --no-verify --allow-dirty` for every publishable
crate in dependency order. Fails if `cargo` cannot assemble the `.crate` archive
(missing files, bad manifest, workspace-path leakage, etc.).

This check does **not** upload anything to crates.io.

### 3 · Documentation Build (`docs` job)

Script: `scripts/check-docs.sh`

Builds the full workspace documentation with:

```text
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings -D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links -D rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links"
cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps
```

Fails on any rustdoc warning or broken intra-doc link.

**docs.rs feature posture:** docs.rs builds each crate with the feature set
declared in `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` (if present), or with no extra features
otherwise. We use `--all-features` here to surface problems across the entire
feature matrix. If a feature is incompatible with docs.rs, add a
`[package.metadata.docs.rs]` section to that crate's `Cargo.toml` listing only
the features docs.rs should enable, and update `check-docs.sh` to build that
crate with the restricted set.

### 4 · SemVer Check (`semver` job)

Script: `scripts/check-semver.sh`

Uses [`cargo-semver-checks`](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks)
to compare the public API surface of each publishable crate against the last
version published on crates.io.

- **Patch / minor releases:** any breaking change fails the gate.
- **Major releases (or breaking pre-1.0 minor):** failures are expected, and
  are cleared with the `skip_semver` `workflow_dispatch` input — not by the
  migration guide. `check-semver.sh` has no knowledge of `docs/migrations/`;
  the guide is enforced separately by the
  [Migration Guide Gate](#migration-guide-gate).

Crates that have never been published are skipped.

### 5 · Release Notes Alignment (`release-notes` job)

Scripts: `scripts/check-release-notes.sh`, `scripts/check-migration-guides.sh`

`check-release-notes.sh` fails if:

- The release tag version does not match `[workspace.package].version` in
  `Cargo.toml`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` has no entry for the current workspace version.
- The release contains breaking changes (a `### Breaking Changes` heading or an
  inline `**Breaking:**` marker in the CHANGELOG entry) but no migration guide
  exists at `docs/migrations/<version>.md`.

`check-migration-guides.sh` is the [Migration Guide
Gate](#migration-guide-gate) below. It also runs on every pull request in the
`lint` job of `ci.yml`, so a breaking change without a guide fails at review
time rather than at tag time.

### 6 · Downstream Smoke Test (`smoke` job)

Defined inline in `publish-gate.yml`.

Creates a temporary directory outside the workspace, generates a minimal Autumn
app skeleton, substitutes the candidate crate set (by path, simulating a crates.io
install), and verifies it compiles. This proves the published `autumn-web` is
usable from a fresh project without workspace path dependencies.

### 6a · Dependency Advisory Gate (`advisories` job)

Script: `scripts/check-advisories.sh`

Fails the release when any crate in the tree being published carries a RustSec
advisory that `deny.toml`, `deny-sqlite.toml`, or the scaffold's shipped
`deny.toml` does not explicitly waive. PR CI runs the same script, but that is
not enough on its own: a tag can be pushed from a commit whose CI predates an
advisory's publication, so the database is fetched fresh at tag time. The
advisory-database fetch retries with backoff and **fails closed** if the
database stays unreachable; the audits then run `--offline` against it, so a
failure names an advisory rather than a network blip.

The job also runs `--self-test`, which audits a throwaway crate with an
injected known-vulnerable dependency (`time 0.1.45`, RUSTSEC-2020-0071) and
requires the gate to reject it — then to accept it once, and only once, that
advisory is waived.

### 6b · SBOM Gate (`sbom` job)

Script: `scripts/check-sbom.sh`

Builds the `autumn` CLI from the checkout being released and uses it to
generate a CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM for the workspace, then:

- **regenerates and compares it component-by-component** (`autumn sbom
  --verify`), so a stale, hand-edited or substituted SBOM fails and the failure
  names the components that drifted;
- requires the SBOM's root component version to equal
  `[workspace.package].version` (`autumn sbom --expect-version`) and, on a tag
  push, requires that to equal the tag;
- runs with `--locked`, so a `Cargo.lock` that disagrees with the manifests is
  a gate failure rather than a silently different dependency set.

The verified file is uploaded as the `sbom` artifact and *downloaded* by
`prepare-release` rather than regenerated there, so the `autumn-<tag>.cdx.json`
attached to the GitHub Release is byte-for-byte the document this gate passed.

Signing happens in a **separate `sbom-attest` job** that checks out nothing and
only downloads that artifact. That separation is deliberate and load-bearing:
`publish-gate.yml` also runs on `pull_request`, and job-level `permissions:`
are not conditional — an `if:` on an attest *step* withholds the step but not
the token. Keeping `id-token: write` / `attestations: write` out of any job
that runs branch code is what stops a contributor's branch from minting
provenance under this repository's identity. `supply_chain.rs` enforces the
invariant across every job in the workflow.

The SBOM is deterministic by construction — no `serialNumber`, no
`metadata.timestamp`, components sorted and de-duplicated — which is what makes
`--verify` possible at all.

### 7 · Published Quickstart Gate (`quickstart-gate` workflow, post-publish)

Workflow: `.github/workflows/quickstart-gate.yml` · Script: `scripts/check-quickstart.sh`

Runs the README quickstart verbatim against the crates **published on
crates.io** — `cargo install autumn-cli`, `autumn new`, `autumn setup`, build,
serve, first 200 from `GET /`, then the README's scaffold path
(`autumn generate scaffold Post ...` → build → `autumn migrate` → `GET /posts`
responds) — and records the install→first-200 funnel time in the job summary.

Unlike gates 1–6, this one cannot run against the release candidate before
publication: it installs from crates.io, so it can only validate crates that
are actually there. It is therefore a **post-publish, pre-announce** gate:

- [ ] After `cargo publish` completes for the release candidate, trigger the
  `Quickstart Gate` workflow manually (Actions → Quickstart Gate → *Run
  workflow*) with the `cli-version` input set to the candidate version
  (e.g. `0.8.0`), or via the CLI:

  ```bash
  gh workflow run quickstart-gate.yml -f cli-version=X.Y.Z
  ```

- [ ] The dispatched run must be **green against the release candidate**
  before the release is announced. A red run is a release blocker for both
  `autumn-web` and `autumn-cli`: fix (or yank and re-publish), re-dispatch,
  and only announce once the gate passes.
- [ ] Confirm the README quickstart's pinned `cargo install autumn-cli
  --version` matches the version just published — the scheduled/push runs of
  the gate install exactly what the README says, so a stale pin turns the
  gate red for every new user.

The gate also runs on every push to `trunk-dev` and on a daily schedule. Those
runs validate the README against the *currently published* crates (never the
pushed code — the workspace `[patch.crates-io]` override means no other CI job
sees the published `autumn-web`), so a red push run means new users are broken
today, not that the commit is bad.

## Plugin Index Re-verification

Each release re-verifies the [plugin index](plugins.md#the-plugin-index)
(issue #1625). After the version bump, `autumn plugin index check` fails,
because each listing was verified on the old release. Two `autumn-cli` unit
tests run the same gate and also fail:
`the_bundled_index_passes_the_gate_for_this_release` and
`run_check_passes_the_bundled_index_on_this_release`.

- [ ] Run the re-verification and keep the reports:
  `PLUGIN_INDEX_REPORTS=<dir> cargo test -p autumn-cli --test generate plugin_index_reverify_listings -- --ignored --exact`
  (or get the `plugin-index-reports` artifact from the `plugin-install` job).
- [ ] Copy `<dir>/index.toml` over `autumn-cli/plugin-index/index.toml`. It
  has the reports already recorded.
- [ ] `cargo run -p autumn-cli -- plugin index check --index autumn-cli/plugin-index/index.toml` passes.
- [ ] Commit `autumn-cli/plugin-index/index.toml` with the release.

A listing that fails is flagged `incompatible`; a second fail on a later
release delists it. See
[`autumn-cli/plugin-index/README.md`](../autumn-cli/plugin-index/README.md).

## Migration Guide Gate

Autumn ships every 2–4 weeks and, pre-1.0, most releases can break existing
apps. **A release with a breaking change does not go out without a migration
guide** — the guide is a gate, not a courtesy (issue #1588). See
[`docs/migrations/README.md`](migrations/README.md) for the process and the
`**Breaking:**` changelog convention.

### Automated

- [ ] `./scripts/check-skill-version-markers.sh` is green (it also runs in CI,
  in the docs-only `migration-guides` job). The `autumn-web`
  agent skill annotates each API with the release it arrived in; those markers
  are hand-maintained and drift silently across a version cut, in several
  punctuation shapes (`(0.7.0)`, `**(0.7.0)**`, `(0.7.0, #1182)`, `(feature
  `tls`, 0.6.0, #1603)`). A marker naming too NEW a release is the damaging
  direction — it tells a reader an API is out of reach when it already shipped.
  The script resolves every issue-referenced marker against the CHANGELOG
  section that introduced it. Markers with no issue reference are counted and
  reported, not checked: skim those by hand when a release adds them.
- [ ] `./scripts/check-migration-guides.sh` is green. It fails on an unmarked
  breaking changelog entry, a breaking section with no guide, a breaking entry
  that does not link its guide, and a guide missing a required section or an
  index entry.
- [ ] `./scripts/check-migration-guides.sh --list` shows the breaking-entry
  count for the release being cut, and it matches what you expect to ship.
- [ ] Every breaking change in the guide carries an `**Automation:**` label
  (`auto` / `review` / `manual`), and each `auto`/`review` entry names a codemod
  that is actually shipped in `autumn-cli/src/upgrade/migrations.rs`. The same
  gate enforces this — see [`docs/migrations/README.md`](migrations/README.md),
  *Classifying a breaking change* (issue #1629).
- [ ] `cargo run -p autumn-cli --bin autumn -- upgrade --list-migrations` shows
  the codemods this release ships, and each one's guide link resolves.

### Rename the rolling draft

- [ ] `git mv docs/migrations/next.md docs/migrations/X.Y.Z.md`.
- [ ] Fill in the version placeholders in the renamed guide (*At a glance*,
  *Before you start*).
- [ ] Repoint every `docs/migrations/next.md` link in the release's `CHANGELOG.md`
  section to `docs/migrations/X.Y.Z.md`.
- [ ] **Recreate `docs/migrations/next.md`** from
  [`TEMPLATE.md`](migrations/TEMPLATE.md) (banner deleted) so the rolling draft
  always exists. [`docs/migrations/README.md`](migrations/README.md) and
  [`STABILITY.md`](../STABILITY.md) both link it by name, and nothing in this
  repo checks markdown links — a missing `next.md` 404s silently until the next
  breaking PR happens to recreate it. Leave the template's `{X.Y.Z}`
  placeholders in place: the gate treats `next.md` as a draft and accepts them
  (and empty sections) there, so you are not inventing details for a release
  that has no changes yet.
- [ ] Update the index in [`docs/migrations/README.md`](migrations/README.md):
  add `X.Y.Z.md`, keep `next.md`.

### Upgrade walk-through (required before `cargo publish`)

The guide is only proven when someone who has not read the diff can follow it.
Perform this against the **previous** release and record the result. It is
**codemod-first**: `autumn upgrade` runs before any manual step, so the steps
that remain are only the changes labelled `review` and `manual` (issue #1629).
The budget is under 30 minutes guide-only, and under 10 once a codemod covers
the release's rename-level changes.

- [ ] `cargo install autumn-cli --version <previous-version>`
- [ ] `autumn new upgrade-probe && cd upgrade-probe && autumn setup`
- [ ] Give the app something to break against: `autumn generate scaffold Post
  title:String body:Text published:bool`, `autumn migrate`, `cargo test`, and a
  `GET /posts` that responds. This is the green baseline.
- [ ] **Run the codemods first, before touching `Cargo.toml`.** The release
  `autumn upgrade` migrates *from* is the one the probe app still records, so
  bumping the dependency first leaves nothing in range and the command reports
  "nothing to change" — which would make this gate pass for the wrong reason.
  Install the candidate CLI, then `autumn upgrade` to read the preview diff and
  the affected-site count, then `autumn upgrade --apply`. Note anything it
  reports under `manual` — those are the sites the guide still has to carry.
- [ ] Now bump `autumn-web` to the release candidate and `cargo check`.
- [ ] Upgrade the rest **following only `docs/migrations/X.Y.Z.md`** — no
  changelog, no source reading, no asking the author. If you have to look
  outside the guide, that is a gap in the guide: fix the guide and restart from
  this step. If a step you had to do by hand was a plain rename, that is a gap
  in the *codemods*: add the migration to
  `autumn-cli/src/upgrade/migrations.rs` and restart.
- [ ] `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and every step in the guide's *How to verify*
  section pass.
- [ ] Record the outcome in the guide's `### Guide-only upgrade walkthrough`
  section (the heading keeps its historical name; the walk-through itself is
  codemod-first): the `- **Codemod:**` invocation you ran first and what it covered,
  then status, from → to versions, elapsed minutes, and any gap the
  walk-through exposed. A guide shipping an `auto`/`review` codemod without the
  codemod line fails the gate. `check-migration-guides.sh` enforces this — a versioned
  guide's status must **begin** with `performed YYYY-MM-DD`. `pending` is
  accepted only on the rolling `next.md` draft, and the one other accepted
  opening, `backfilled`, means "this guide was written after its release
  shipped" and is a visible claim in the diff.

## Version Alignment

- [ ] `Cargo.toml` workspace `version` and `rust-version` match the README
  requirements and first-run docs.
- [ ] `autumn-web`, `autumn-cli`, and `autumn-macros` publish metadata point at
  the same repository, license, and release line.
- [ ] CHANGELOG entries call out any MSRV change.

## Automated Gates

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace`
- [ ] `cargo test -p autumn-cli --test cli_tests repo_hygiene` — `repo_hygiene`
  is a module inside the consolidated `cli_tests` binary, not a test target of
  its own, so `--test repo_hygiene` errors with "no test target named".
- [ ] `RELEASE_TAG=v<version> ./scripts/check-sbom.sh` — the SBOM gate, run
  locally before tagging so a drifted lockfile is caught before CI.
- [ ] `./scripts/check-advisories.sh` — the advisory gate, run locally before
  tagging so a newly published RUSTSEC advisory is triaged (fixed or waived
  with a reason) before it blocks the tag.

## First-Run Docs Gate

- [ ] Run the `docs-smoke` procedure in
  [`docs/guide/docs-smoke.md`](guide/docs-smoke.md).
- [ ] Confirm the smoke uses the published `autumn-cli` install path and the
  published `autumn-web` dependency line, with no workspace patches.
- [ ] Treat any failure in the active first-run docs as a release blocker for
  both `autumn-web` and `autumn-cli`.
- [ ] If the smoke is temporarily run before crates.io publication, record the
  workspace-prepublish reason in release notes and rerun the published
  docs-smoke before announcing the release.

## Manual Pre-Tag Steps

Before pushing the release tag:

1. **Bump the workspace version** in `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.package]`.
2. **Update internal version pins** for inter-crate dependencies
   (e.g. `autumn-web = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "../autumn" }`).
   Also bump any hard-coded plugin compatibility range that boots against the
   workspace: `.autumn_web("X.Y")` in `examples/` (e.g.
   `examples/react-graphql/src/graphql_plugin.rs`). A stale range makes the
   plugin-contract check refuse to start the example, and the *Example fleet
   e2e gate* fails. Plugins in this repo that release in lockstep use
   `lockstep_contract(..)` and need nothing.
3. **Fold the changelog fragments in** — `./scripts/update-changelog.sh`
   merges every `changelog.d/` file into `## [Unreleased]` under the kind it
   declares, then deletes the files. Read the result: it is the release note
   people get. Then move the items under a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading. Every breaking
   entry carries the `**Breaking:**` marker (or sits under a
   `### Breaking Changes` heading) and links its migration guide.

   A release PR is the one change allowed to edit `CHANGELOG.md`. Put the
   literal token `[changelog]` in its body, or apply the `release` label, or
   `./scripts/check-changelog-fragments.sh` fails it.
4. **Complete the [Migration Guide Gate](#migration-guide-gate)** — rename
   `docs/migrations/next.md`, repoint the changelog links, and perform and
   record the codemod-first upgrade walk-through.
5. **Refresh the dependency floor.** Review the open Dependabot PRs and fold
   the semver-compatible ones into the release rather than tagging on top of a
   month-old lockfile: `cargo update`, plus any manifest bound a grouped PR
   widens. Majors that need API work are a separate change — decide
   deliberately whether each rides this release, and say so in the changelog.
6. **Write the [release walkthrough](releases/README.md)** —
   `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md`, cut after the CHANGELOG section is final. It is
   the narrative counterpart to the changelog: what shipped, why, and what it
   looks like in an app. Link it from the CHANGELOG section header, from the
   README's *Documentation* list, and from the migration guide's header.
7. **Run all gate scripts locally** to catch problems before CI sees the tag:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-crate-metadata.sh
   ./scripts/check-changelog-fragments.sh
   ./scripts/check-release-notes.sh
   ./scripts/check-migration-guides.sh
   ./scripts/check-skill-version-markers.sh
   ./scripts/check-docs.sh
   ./scripts/check-semver.sh   # requires network; skip offline
   ```
8. **Tag and push:**
   ```bash
   git tag v0.8.0
   git push origin v0.8.0
   ```
   The `publish-gate` workflow runs automatically. The `release` workflow runs
   only after `publish-gate` succeeds.
9. **Publish to crates.io** (in dependency order, after the gate passes):
   Order matters: each crate's Autumn dependencies must already be on
   crates.io, or `cargo publish` fails to resolve them. In particular
   `autumn-web` pins `autumn-edge`, the two macro shards and `autumn-macros`,
   and `autumn-cli` pins `autumn-schema-core`, so all of them precede their
   dependants here. `autumn-macros-support` is first: the other three macro
   crates pin it.
   ```bash
   cargo publish -p autumn-macros-support
   cargo publish -p autumn-macros
   cargo publish -p autumn-macros-model
   cargo publish -p autumn-macros-repository
   cargo publish -p autumn-schema-core
   cargo publish -p autumn-edge
   cargo publish -p autumn-web
   cargo publish -p autumn-cli
   cargo publish -p autumn-admin-plugin
   cargo publish -p autumn-media-plugin
   cargo publish -p autumn-storage-s3
   cargo publish -p autumn-cache-redis
   cargo publish -p autumn-search
   cargo publish -p autumn-billing
   ```
10. **Gate the published quickstart** (see
