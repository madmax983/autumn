# Autumn Release Checklist

This document is the canonical pre-publish checklist for every Autumn release.
It records the crates we publish, the required publication order, the version
compatibility rule for each crate, and the automated gates that must pass before
a tag triggers a GitHub Release.

See also [`STABILITY.md`](../STABILITY.md) for the full stability policy and
SemVer contract.

## Published Crates

| Crate | Directory | Publish Order | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `autumn-macros` | `autumn-macros/` | 1 | No Autumn runtime deps; must publish first. |
| `autumn-web` | `autumn/` | 2 | Depends on `autumn-macros`. |
| `autumn-cli` | `autumn-cli/` | 3 | Independent of `autumn-web` at crate level. |
| `autumn-admin-plugin` | `autumn-admin-plugin/` | 4 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-storage-s3` | `autumn-storage-s3/` | 4 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |
| `autumn-cache-redis` | `autumn-cache-redis/` | 4 | Depends on `autumn-web`. |

All crates share a single workspace version (`[workspace.package].version` in
`Cargo.toml`). They are always released together at the same version.

### Version Compatibility Rules

- Every crate's `version` field inherits from `[workspace.package].version`.
- Crates that depend on other published Autumn crates pin the **exact workspace
  version** (e.g. `autumn-web = { version = "0.4.0", ... }`). A workspace
  version bump must update these pins in lockstep.
- The `[patch.crates-io]` override in the root `Cargo.toml` redirects
  `autumn-web` to the local workspace path during development. **Remove or
  comment this section** if you ever need to test against a published version
  locally.

## Autumn Harvest Compatibility Boundary

[Autumn Harvest](https://github.com/madmax983/autumn-harvest) is a companion
repository that provides starter templates, the scaffold generator registry, and
generated application CI. It is maintained on its own release train.

**Checks that belong in this repo:**

- Autumn framework crate packaging, docs.rs build, and SemVer gate.
- CLI commands shipped by `autumn-cli`.
- Generated application smoke test (see [Downstream Smoke Test](#downstream-smoke-test)).

**Checks that belong in the Harvest repo:**

- Template rendering correctness and starter project CI.
- Harvest-specific CLI flags and template version pins.
- Integration tests that use the Harvest template registry API.

When an Autumn release changes the generated-app contract (config schema,
generated file structure, CLI flags), open a companion PR in the Harvest repo
before tagging the Autumn release.

## Automated Gates (`publish-gate` Workflow)

The `.github/workflows/publish-gate.yml` workflow runs these jobs. Each must
pass before the release is announced.

### 1 · Crate Metadata (`metadata` job)

Script: `scripts/check-crate-metadata.sh`

Fails if any publishable crate is missing:

- `description`, `homepage`, `repository`, `readme`, `license`,
  `keywords`, `categories`, `rust-version`
- The `readme` file referenced in the manifest actually exists on disk.

### 2 · Package Dry-Run (`package` job)

Script: `scripts/check-publish-dry-run.sh`

Runs `cargo package -p <crate> --no-verify --allow-dirty` for every publishable
crate in dependency order. Fails if `cargo` cannot assemble the `.crate` archive
(missing files, bad manifest, workspace-path leakage, etc.).

This check does **not** upload anything to crates.io.

### 3 · Documentation Build (`docs` job)

Script: `scripts/check-docs.sh`

Builds the full workspace documentation with:

```text
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings -D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links -D rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links"
cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps
```

Fails on any rustdoc warning or broken intra-doc link.

**docs.rs feature posture:** docs.rs builds each crate with the feature set
declared in `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` (if present), or with no extra features
otherwise. We use `--all-features` here to surface problems across the entire
feature matrix. If a feature is incompatible with docs.rs, add a
`[package.metadata.docs.rs]` section to that crate's `Cargo.toml` listing only
the features docs.rs should enable, and update `check-docs.sh` to build that
crate with the restricted set.

### 4 · SemVer Check (`semver` job)

Script: `scripts/check-semver.sh`

Uses [`cargo-semver-checks`](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks)
to compare the public API surface of each publishable crate against the last
version published on crates.io.

- **Patch / minor releases:** any breaking change fails the gate.
- **Major releases (or breaking pre-1.0 minor):** failures are expected.
  The release operator must ensure a migration guide exists at
  `docs/migrations/<version>.md` before the gate passes.

Crates that have never been published are skipped.

### 5 · Release Notes Alignment (`release-notes` job)

Script: `scripts/check-release-notes.sh`

Fails if:

- The release tag version does not match `[workspace.package].version` in
  `Cargo.toml`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` has no entry for the current workspace version.
- The release contains breaking changes (detected via `### Breaking` in the
  CHANGELOG entry) but no migration guide exists at
  `docs/migrations/<version>.md`.

### 6 · Downstream Smoke Test (`smoke` job)

Defined inline in `publish-gate.yml`.

Creates a temporary directory outside the workspace, generates a minimal Autumn
app skeleton, substitutes the candidate crate set (by path, simulating a crates.io
install), and verifies it compiles. This proves the published `autumn-web` is
usable from a fresh project without workspace path dependencies.

## Version Alignment

- [ ] `Cargo.toml` workspace `version` and `rust-version` match the README
  requirements and first-run docs.
- [ ] `autumn-web`, `autumn-cli`, and `autumn-macros` publish metadata point at
  the same repository, license, and release line.
- [ ] CHANGELOG entries call out any MSRV change.

## Automated Gates

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace`
- [ ] `cargo test -p autumn-cli --test repo_hygiene`

## First-Run Docs Gate

- [ ] Run the `docs-smoke` procedure in
  [`docs/guide/docs-smoke.md`](guide/docs-smoke.md).
- [ ] Confirm the smoke uses the published `autumn-cli` install path and the
  published `autumn-web` dependency line, with no workspace patches.
- [ ] Treat any failure in the active first-run docs as a release blocker for
  both `autumn-web` and `autumn-cli`.
- [ ] If the smoke is temporarily run before crates.io publication, record the
  workspace-prepublish reason in release notes and rerun the published
  docs-smoke before announcing the release.

## Manual Pre-Tag Steps

Before pushing the release tag:

1. **Bump the workspace version** in `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.package]`.
2. **Update internal version pins** for inter-crate dependencies
   (e.g. `autumn-web = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "../autumn" }`).
3. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** — move unreleased items under a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading.
   Add a `### Breaking Changes` section and migration guide stub if needed.
4. **Run all gate scripts locally** to catch problems before CI sees the tag:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-crate-metadata.sh
   ./scripts/check-release-notes.sh
   ./scripts/check-docs.sh
   ./scripts/check-semver.sh   # requires network; skip offline
   ```
5. **Tag and push:**
   ```bash
   git tag v0.4.0
   git push origin v0.4.0
   ```
   The `publish-gate` workflow runs automatically. The `release` workflow runs
   only after `publish-gate` succeeds.
6. **Publish to crates.io** (in dependency order, after the gate passes):
   ```bash
   cargo publish -p autumn-macros
   cargo publish -p autumn-web
   cargo publish -p autumn-cli
   cargo publish -p autumn-admin-plugin
   cargo publish -p autumn-storage-s3
   cargo publish -p autumn-cache-redis
   ```

> Publishing to crates.io is a manual step; no crates.io credentials are stored
> in CI. See the Out of Scope section in [issue #594](https://github.com/madmax983/autumn/issues/594).
