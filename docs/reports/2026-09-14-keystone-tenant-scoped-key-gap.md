# 🏛️ Keystone [findings]: three shipped cross-tenant leaks, three different fixes, no shared primitive for "fold the ambient tenant into a derived key"

- Status: Findings memo (not an RFC — see Reversibility)
- Date: 2026-09-14
- Author: Keystone (architecture review agent)

## 🎯 Scope

System boundary examined: framework subsystems that compute a **derived
key** from ambient request context — an idempotency storage slot, a
`#[cached]` memoization key, a rate-limit bucket, a plugin KV namespace —
to decide "is this the same logical operation/entity as last time," under
Autumn's opt-in, retrofitted row-level multi-tenancy
(`autumn/src/tenancy.rs`, ADR-less feature landed 2026-05-22, #876).

**Explicitly out of scope, and not an omission from this inventory:**
`autumn/src/cache/layer.rs`'s `CacheResponseLayer` also derives a key from
request context (URI path + query, `layer.rs:90-110,188-218`) — but by
documented, load-bearing contract, not by accident: its own rustdoc says
*"that last rule is the whole contract: the key is the URI and nothing
else... [wrapping a handler whose body varies per-visitor] leaks one
visitor's page to the next... So either keep per-visitor routes out of
this layer entirely, or give the cache a key that includes what the
response varies on."* It is the caller's job to never wrap a
tenant-varying handler in it, not the layer's job to fold in tenant — the
opposite design from the four sites below, which all promise tenant
isolation *automatically*. The 2026-09-02 idempotency report already
checked and excluded this exact surface for this exact reason
(`docs/security/2026-09-02-idempotency-tenant-scope/README.md:111-114`,
"Checked and **not** affected"); this memo does not re-litigate that call.

## 📈 Evidence (Tier 2 — repository record)

**Three independent, shipped cross-tenant defects, same shape, found one at
a time by manual security audit over 7 days, each fixed with its own
one-off encoding:**

| Date fixed | Subsystem | Vulnerable code introduced | Commit | Bespoke fix shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-02 | `idempotency` (`AppBuilder::idempotent()`) | 2026-05-18, #779 (`75bc830a`) — 4 days *before* tenancy | `465229fa` (#2447) | `StorageKeyContext` struct gains a `tenant` field, captured once from the `CURRENT_TENANT` task-local (`autumn/src/idempotency.rs:144-180`) |
| 2026-09-07 | `#[cached]` (`autumn-macros::cached`) | 2026-03-29, #53 (`7e8d2763`) — ~2 months *before* tenancy | `96e7353f` (#2528) | Key becomes a tuple `(Option<String>, #key_args)`, the tenant read inline at macro-expansion time (`autumn-macros/src/cached.rs:620-627`) |
| 2026-09-09 | rate limiter (`AuthenticatedPrincipal` bucket) | 2026-05-30, #1001 (`77284d73`) — 8 days *after* tenancy | `ebf4a837` (#2653) | New free function `tenant_qualify_bucket_key`, a hand-rolled tagged-string encoding (`t<len>:`/`n:` prefixes) to keep tenant-present and tenant-absent keyspaces disjoint (`autumn/src/security/rate_limit.rs:784`) |

All three are documented in their own write-ups
(`docs/security/2026-09-02-idempotency-tenant-scope/README.md`,
`.../2026-09-05-cached-tenant-key/README.md`,
`.../2026-09-09-rate-limit-tenant-key/README.md`) as: *"Affected: `autumn-web`
0.7.0 and every earlier release [that shipped this subsystem]"* — that
quote is each report's own words, describing when the vulnerable *source
code* existed, not necessarily when it was an exploitable cross-tenant
defect. Tenancy itself has no release before 0.5.0 (2026-06-16,
`CHANGELOG.md:13404`), so `#[cached]`'s omission was latent, not
exploitable, in 0.2.0-0.4.0 (2026-04-19 through 2026-05-12) — those
releases could not compose `#[cached]` with a tenancy feature that did
not yet exist. Idempotency and rate limiting's `AuthenticatedPrincipal`
strategy both first shipped in 0.5.0 too (each landed after 0.4.0's
2026-05-12 cut and before 0.5.0's 2026-06-16 release), so for all three,
the actually-affected published range is uniform and starts at 0.5.0, not
at each subsystem's own, earlier source-code introduction: roughly 2.5-3
months of real exposure per subsystem, from 0.5.0 to its fix, not the
"3-4 months" an earlier draft of this memo computed from `#[cached]`'s
March introduction.

**A fourth, independent data point — this time correct on the first try —
confirms there is still no shared primitive to reach for.** `autumn/src/plugin_sandbox/capability/kv.rs:104`,
added `847bd875` (2026-09-06, mid-week between the idempotency and cached
fixes), defines `pub fn namespaced_key(plugin: &str, tenant: Option<&str>, key: &str) -> String` —
a *fourth* distinct encoding of "fold an optional tenant into a derived
key," built from scratch rather than reused, because nothing in
`autumn_web::tenancy` offers a canonical one to call.

**Two of the three were legacy code no one revisited; the third shows the
gap isn't just a legacy retrofit problem.** `#[cached]` (2026-03-29) and
idempotency (2026-05-18) both predate tenancy (2026-05-22) and were never
swept when it shipped — the retrofit story. But the rate limiter's
specific vulnerable code, the `AuthenticatedPrincipal` key strategy, was
added in `77284d73` (2026-05-30, #1001) — **8 days after** tenancy already
existed in the same codebase — and still built its bucket key with no
tenant component. (The rate limiter's *original* commit, `68ccadab`,
2026-04-20, shipped only per-IP limiting; `AuthenticatedPrincipal` is a
separate, later addition and is the one this memo's fix touches.) That
rules out "just needs one sweep the week tenancy landed" as a sufficient
fix: this is not only about code written before a cross-cutting concern
existed, but about nothing in the framework prompting a developer adding
a *new* derived-key feature, afterward, to ask whether tenancy applies to
it. Each of the three was found only when a dedicated audit pass (the "Warden"
persona) happened to point at it — one every ~5 weeks on average since
tenancy landed, three in the last 7 days once that audit cycle reached this
class of bug — no check caught any of them *before* that audit found
them and its fix shipped a dedicated regression test (see 🔧
Recommendation, item 2: all four now have one, running in CI). The gap is
narrower than "no CI check catches this shape" — it is "nothing catches
this shape in a derived-key builder that has not yet been through that
cycle." Separately, `autumn cache audit`
(`autumn-cli/src/cache_audit.rs`) proves cache *invalidation* coverage,
never key composition, for any cached read either way — and that
invalidation gate already reaches further than `#[cached]` alone, via
`declare_cached_read!` for the fragment and read-through caches
(`autumn/src/cache/coherence.rs:864-899`,
`docs/guide/cache-coherence.md:259-267`). Idempotency and rate-limiting
have no equivalent invalidation gate of any kind, but that is a distinct
point from tenant-key coverage: the behavioral tests named in 🔧
Recommendation, item 2 *do* check tenant-key composition for the known
flows they cover. What no gate here or elsewhere checks is tenant-key
composition *systematically* — automatically, for a derived-key builder
nobody has written a dedicated test for yet, which is exactly the state
every one of today's four builders was in before 2026-09-02.
`grep -rn "CURRENT_TENANT"` finds 142 lines across 25 files today — most
are the correct, declarative `#[repository(..., tenant_scoped)]` path; the
four discussed here are the ad hoc, imperative ones that middleware/macros
hand-roll for a derived key, which is exactly the shape with no gate. (A
narrower single-line pattern anchored on `.try_with`/`.with` undercounts
this: `idempotency.rs` and `cached.rs` both wrap the method call onto its
own line, so a single-line grep misses two of the four examples in this
memo entirely — a real limitation of grep-as-enforcement mechanism, not
just of this reproduce command; see Recommendation 2.)

## 🧭 Do nothing / decide later — 12-month baseline

The three known instances are fixed. The cost still being paid is the
*mechanism* that produced them: nothing stops a fifth. Autumn ships new
cross-cutting, request-scoped subsystems regularly — `#[endpoint]`/wire
contracts landed this week (`6e71bfb`, #2729) with an explicitly
self-flagged open edge of its own (rolling-deploy version skew,
unrelated to this finding but the same *pattern* of "ship first, audit the
cross-cutting property later"). If the next one memoizes or buckets by a
derived key under `[tenancy]`, it will be found the same way these three
were: a manual audit pass, sometime later, after shipping in at least one
release. That is a real, currently-paid recurring cost (audit-and-patch
cycles, ~1 per week during an active sweep), not a projected one — but it
is bounded and has caused no known production incident (no Tier-1 data
exists either way; this is a framework, not an operated service). Leaving
it alone costs nothing catastrophic; it costs one more audit-and-patch
cycle whenever the next such subsystem ships, same as the last three.

## 💡 Hypothesis

Multi-tenancy is opt-in and cross-cutting: it applies to a derived-key
builder only if that builder's author remembers it applies. Two of the
three fixes are explained by a retrofit gap — the builder predates
tenancy and nobody swept it afterward. The third is not: rate limiting's
`AuthenticatedPrincipal` strategy was written 8 days *after* tenancy
already existed, by someone who had every opportunity to consult it, and
still didn't. So the mechanism is broader than "legacy code missed a
retrofit" — nothing in the framework requires *any* request-scoped
derived-key builder, written before or after tenancy landed, to declare
and be checked on whether it needs to fold in the ambient tenant. Each
instance is discovered by a human (or audit persona) reading the code
fresh, independently reinventing both the discovery and the fix. This is
the same shape as the
already-published `#[query_budget]` coverage-gap finding
(`docs/reports/2026-09-05-keystone-query-budget-coverage-gap-findings.md`):
a real property, no systematic enforcement, found piecemeal.

## 🔧 Recommendation — not a decision, and deliberately not an RFC

**Reversibility: both items below turn out to need less doing than earlier
drafts of this memo claimed, not more — item 1 is a documentation
nice-to-have and item 2 is withdrawn outright, once existing test coverage
is accounted for.** Per this framework's own rule — *"if reversal costs
under ~2 engineer-weeks, the implementing team decides it in a PR
description"* — neither clears the bar for an RFC, and neither is even a
PR-sized ask by the time the corrections below are applied. Recorded as a
findings memo anyway because the connection across three
separately-audited-and-fixed CVE-shaped defects and one shared root cause
had not been made anywhere before this pass — the value here is in the
pattern-naming (📈 Evidence, 💡 Hypothesis), not in either recommendation
below.

1. **No single shared *encoding* primitive is actually viable across all
   four sites — downgraded to a documentation nice-to-have, not a fix.**
   The four sites' physical key formats are incompatible in kind, not just
   in tag scheme: `idempotency.rs`'s `build_storage_key` folds the tenant
   into a SHA-256 digest input (`push_storage_key_component`,
   `autumn/src/idempotency.rs:180-200`); `#[cached]`'s `make_cache_key`
   folds the `Option<String>` tenant (discriminant and value both) into a
   `DefaultHasher` hash of a Rust tuple (`autumn/src/cache/mod.rs:517-521`)
   — non-cryptographic, but not merely in-process either: when a shared
   Redis backend is registered, `autumn-cache-redis/src/lib.rs:307-318`'s
   `insert_raw_bytes` is "the primary write path for `#[cached]`-annotated
   functions," persisting this exact key string (with an optional,
   `#[cached]`-declared TTL — no expiry at all when none is set) as a real
   Redis key. Changing `make_cache_key`'s output format has the same
   stranded-data risk as idempotency's and plugin KV's byte-compatibility
   constraints below, not a weaker one; `rate_limit.rs`'s
   `tenant_qualify_bucket_key` emits a tagged plain string (`t<len>:`/`n:`
   prefixes); `plugin_sandbox`'s `namespaced_key` emits a colon-delimited
   string with each segment passed through `escape_segment`/
   `tenant_segment`. A function returning one canonical `Option<String>`
   for all four to fold in can't simultaneously produce four different
   physical shapes — the disjointness guarantee is exactly the part that
   has to stay bespoke per site. What's actually shareable shrinks to the
   trivial step of *obtaining* the raw tenant value, which is already
   close to a one-liner at three of the four sites
   (`CURRENT_TENANT.try_with(Clone::clone).ok().flatten()`) and an
   explicit parameter at the fourth (`plugin_sandbox`, which deliberately
   does **not** read `CURRENT_TENANT` — see below). De-duplicating one
   line has little value on its own. There is also a public-API asymmetry
   worth naming for whoever revisits this: `idempotency.rs`,
   `rate_limit.rs`, and `plugin_sandbox/capability/kv.rs` all live inside
   the `autumn` crate itself, so anything shared only among those three
   could stay `pub(crate)` — zero public-API cost, a genuine two-way door.
   `#[cached]`, however, is a proc macro (`autumn-macros`) whose *generated
   code* is inserted into whatever downstream crate calls it — any helper
   that generated code invokes must be Rust-visible as `pub` from there.
   That does *not* force it into the stable, SemVer-covered API, though:
   `STABILITY.md:78-82` explicitly excludes anything marked
   `#[doc(hidden)]` from stability guarantees, and `STABILITY.md:240` lists
   "tightening `#[doc(hidden)]` items or removing them entirely" as a
   non-breaking change outright — no deprecation ramp required.
   `autumn/src/counter_cache.rs:715,840,863,899,1204` already uses exactly
   this `#[doc(hidden)] pub fn`/`pub enum` pattern for macro-generated-code
   seams, so a new helper for `#[cached]` to call could follow the same
   precedent and stay a genuine two-way door. (An earlier draft of this
   memo claimed the opposite — that any symbol `#[cached]`'s expansion
   calls is necessarily gated by the deprecation ramp; that was wrong,
   corrected here rather than repeated.) The reason item 1 is still
   downgraded is the encoding-incompatibility point above, not this one.
2. **Withdrawn: the regression coverage this item proposed to add already
   exists, is stronger than what was proposed, and already runs in CI.**
   Each of the three fixes shipped its own dedicated behavioral test file
   alongside the code change — the same house practice, not something
   this memo needs to ask for: `idempotency_tenant_scope.rs`'s
   `header_tenancy_does_not_replay_across_tenants`
   (`autumn/tests/integration/idempotency_tenant_scope.rs:60-100`, opening
   comment: *"Warden 2026-09-02"*) drives two real requests as two tenants
   through the actual router and asserts tenant B never receives tenant
   A's cached body; `rate_limit_tenant_scope.rs` covers *both* call sites
   named above — `global_limiter_principal_bucket_isolated_by_tenant`
   (line 105) for `resolve_key_and_params` and
   `per_route_throttle_principal_bucket_isolated_by_tenant` (line 159) for
   `__check_throttle` — each asserting tenant B is never denied service by
   tenant A's exhausted bucket; `cached_tenant_scope.rs:133-187` does the
   same for `#[cached]`, gated `#[ignore = "requires Docker
   (testcontainers)"]` and swept by ci.yml's documented bare `--ignored`
   Docker sweep (see CLAUDE.md), not skipped; and
   `plugin_sandbox_capabilities.rs`'s
   `the_tenant_a_mounted_plugin_binds_to_is_the_requests_own` (line
   735-787) is, in its own words, *"the wiring nothing else in this suite
   reaches... delete that line and every other test here still passes
   while every tenant silently shares one namespace"* — asserting exactly
   one KV key per tenant, not one shared. That claim about "every other
   test" was correct only for the acquisition site it names
   (`plugin.rs:579-583`, reached through `serve`/`mounted_router`): it
   does **not** extend to `SandboxedPlugin::render_slot`
   (`plugin.rs:291-297`), which reads `CURRENT_TENANT` through its own,
   independent capture rather than the one `serve` uses. Every
   `render_slot` call in this test file (lines 859, 872, 875, 887, 933,
   943) runs outside a `with_tenant` scope — `with_tenant` appears exactly
   once in the whole file, in the `mounted_router` test — so no existing
   test would notice if `render_slot`'s capture were deleted, even though
   its output feeds the same `namespaced_key` encoder the mounted-router
   path does. Corrected claim: three of the four subsystems (idempotency,
   rate limiting at both call sites, `#[cached]`) and *one of
   `plugin_sandbox`'s two acquisition sites* have real, behavioral,
   end-to-end regression coverage running in CI today — strictly stronger
   proof than a structural hygiene test would have given, for the paths
   it actually covers. `render_slot`'s capture is a real, currently
   uncovered gap this memo did not know about until this review caught
   it; item 2 is still withdrawn as originally scoped (a source-shape
   hygiene test would not have caught this gap either — it isn't a
   missing call site, it's an existing call site with no behavioral
   test), but this specific gap is worth a targeted test in its own
   right, independent of anything this memo recommends.

   A second qualification, this one *not* new: the existing
   `rate_limit_tenant_scope.rs` coverage only exercises the normally
   configured middleware stack. In a `dist`/static-serving build,
   `try_build_router_with_static_inner` deliberately drains
   `AppBuilder::layer`/`static_gate` custom layers — a custom
   `RateLimitLayer` among them — and reapplies them *outside* both the
   static-first middleware and `tenancy_middleware` (`router.rs:5760-5771`),
   so `tenant_qualify_bucket_key` sees no ambient tenant there regardless
   of whether its own logic is intact. This is not a hole this review
   found: the rate-limit security report already named it as **P1**
   (`docs/security/2026-09-09-rate-limit-tenant-key/README.md:214-230`),
   explicitly "not a gap introduced by this fix, and not fixable at this
   layer" — the ordering is deliberate (compression needs pre-rendered
   responses, static serving must survive a down session backend, ISR
   needs raw HTML) and affects *every* tenant-aware feature's custom
   layers in that mode, not rate limiting specifically. Citing it here so
   this memo's "behavioral coverage exists" claim doesn't read as broader
   than the coverage actually is.

What's left, once both items are corrected, is not a fix but an honest
gap statement: nothing in this framework prompts a *new* derived-key
builder to get the same behavioral-test treatment these four received
*after* being found vulnerable — that treatment is applied per-incident,
by the audit that found each bug, not by any standing requirement. A
fifth builder, written from scratch tomorrow, starts with zero coverage
of this shape until someone thinks to add it, the same way these four
did before 2026-09-02. Closing that requires recognizing *new* derived-key
*construction* — a function whose return value backs a cache, dedup, or
rate-limit lookup — as a class needing this treatment by default, which
is a semantic property no grep or call-site allow-list can detect. This
memo does not design that check; naming it as the actual unsolved half of
the gap, rather than proposing a hygiene test that duplicates existing
coverage, is the corrected conclusion.

This does not require resolving whether other not-yet-audited subsystems
have the same gap today — that would be a fresh audit, not an
architecture decision, and this memo does not claim to have performed one.
