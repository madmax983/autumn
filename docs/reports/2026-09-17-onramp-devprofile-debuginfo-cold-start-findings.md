# 🛣️ Onramp: dev-profile debug info is a real cold-start lever, but it costs backtrace quality (findings, needs a human decision)

## 🎯 Journey

**First run** (`autumn new` → `cargo build` → first HTTP 200), the no-DB daemon
shape the `Cold-Start Onboarding Gate` (`.github/workflows/cold-start-latency.yml`)
measures — the same highest-weighted journey the two prior reports on issue
#2795 investigated (`docs/reports/2026-09-02-prospect-cold-start-db-gate-verify.md`,
`docs/reports/2026-09-03-prospect-cold-start-post-fix-bisect.md`) and the most
recent follow-up closed as a negative result
(`docs/reports/2026-09-16-onramp-test-sim-compile-gate-negative-result.md`, PR
#2817).

Reproduce: see **🔬 Reproduce** below.

## 📈 Evidence / Prior art

Issue #2795 (open) names `autumn-web`'s own hand-written source as the current
bottleneck (~43-55s of the no-DB daemon build) and, after PR #2817's negative
result on gating `test`/`sim`, its own "what this leaves for #2795's next
attempt" section calls for `-Z self-profile` plus a query-time summarizer to
get real per-item attribution inside the ~22s "frontend" (type-check/MIR/
borrowck) phase, rather than another line-count-driven module-removal guess.

This report attempted exactly that tool and could not run it in this
environment: `-Z self-profile` needs the `measureme` crate's `summarize`/`crox`
tool to decode its binary trace format, and this sandbox's egress policy
returns `403` for `crates.io` (`curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://crates.io` →
`403`), so `cargo install` cannot fetch it, and no pre-installed copy exists.
`rustup toolchain list` also shows only `stable`; a full nightly is not
installed either, though that turned out not to matter — `-Z` flags work on
the installed stable `rustc 1.94.1` via `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`, the trace
*decoding* step is what's actually blocked. Recorded here so the next attempt
doesn't re-discover the same dead end: **`-Z self-profile` needs network
access to `crates.io` (or a vendored copy of `measureme`) to be useful in this
sandbox; it is not simply a compiler flag away.**

Falling back to `-Z time-passes` (also stable-compatible via
`RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`, no decoder needed — it prints per-pass wall time directly
to stderr) gave real, if coarser, signal on one run of
`cargo build -p autumn-web --no-default-features --features
maud,htmx,tailwind,reporting`:

| pass | time |
|---|---|
| `LLVM_passes` | 12.75s |
| `codegen_crate` | 11.86s |
| `codegen_to_LLVM_IR` | 11.45s |
| `MIR_borrow_checking` | 9.86s |
| `generate_crate_metadata` | 8.73s |
| `type_check_crate` | 8.66s |
| `monomorphization_collector_graph_walk` | 6.29s |
| `coherence_checking` | 3.34s |
| `macro_expand_crate` | 3.86s |

(total unit time 46.15s on this run).

**Correction (thanks to review on PR #2829): an earlier draft of this
paragraph summed `LLVM_passes` + `codegen_crate` + `codegen_to_LLVM_IR` +
`monomorphization_collector_graph_walk` into a ~42.4s "backend total" and
compared it against a ~25.7s frontend sum to claim backend work is at least
as large as frontend work. That comparison is invalid and has been retracted:
`codegen_to_LLVM_IR` and `LLVM_passes` are not siblings of `codegen_crate`,
they run *inside* it (per-codegen-unit, potentially across multiple threads
in parallel), so adding all three double- or triple-counts the same wall-clock
window rather than measuring three disjoint spans. The numbers make this
visible on inspection: `codegen_to_LLVM_IR` (11.45s) + `LLVM_passes` (12.75s)
alone already exceeds `codegen_crate`'s own reported 11.86s, which is only
possible if the "children" are concurrent work being separately accounted,
not sequential sub-phases that sum to their parent. `-Z time-passes`'s flat,
unindented output does not distinguish nested/parallel timers from disjoint
ones, so it cannot support a "frontend vs. backend dominance" claim on its
own — that would need `-Z self-profile`'s query-level accounting (blocked in
this sandbox, see above) or manually identifying which timers are mutually
exclusive. The individual numbers above are still real per-pass wall times,
just not addable into the totals the first draft claimed.

What still motivates looking at `-C debuginfo` specifically, independent of
that retracted comparison: `LLVM_passes` (12.75s) and `codegen_to_LLVM_IR`
(11.45s) are each, individually, a large fraction of the 46.15s unit total,
and both are partly driven by how much debug metadata rustc asks LLVM to
generate — controlled by `-C debuginfo` (Cargo's `[profile.dev] debug` key).
That is a concrete, directly testable lever regardless of how the phases
decompose, which is what **🧪 Apparatus**/**📊 Assay** below measure directly
by A/B'ing the flag rather than relying on any further inference from
`time-passes` output. Neither this
workspace's root `Cargo.toml` nor `autumn-cli`'s generated-project templates
(`autumn-cli/src/templates/Cargo.toml.tmpl`, `Cargo.api.toml.tmpl`) set
`[profile.dev]` at all, so every `cargo build` — the real gate's included —
runs at Cargo's own default, `debug = true` (`-C debuginfo=2`, full debug
info: line tables plus variable/type info for a real debugger).

## 💡 Hypothesis

Full debug info (`-C debuginfo=2`) is measurably more expensive for LLVM to
emit than reduced levels, and since the no-DB daemon template sets no
`[profile.dev]` override, every `autumn new` project — including the one
`cold-start-latency.yml` scaffolds — pays the most expensive level by default
purely because nothing ever chose a cheaper one.

**Falsifiable question:** does lowering `-C debuginfo` for `autumn-web`'s own
build reduce wall-clock time by an amount that would matter for the cold-start
gate?

## 🧪 Apparatus

Same box as this session (4 vCPU, rustc/cargo 1.94.1). Built
`cargo build -p autumn-web --no-default-features --features
maud,htmx,tailwind,reporting` (same feature set `DAEMON_NO_DB_FEATURES` maps
to, per the same caveat the 2026-09-16 report already recorded: this omits
the `flash` feature the real generated-project template's `default = ["flash"]`
carries, and builds `-p autumn-web` directly rather than the actual scaffolded
project `cold_start_driver.rs` builds — so absolute numbers here are not
directly comparable to the gate's own reported figures, only the *relative*
delta between conditions is). `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, fully-cold `autumn-web`
artifacts every run (`target/debug/deps/libautumn_web*`,
`.fingerprint/autumn-web-*`, `incremental/autumn_web-*` removed before each
build), dependencies left warm. Wall-clock via `date +%s.%N` around the
`cargo build` invocation (this sandbox has no `/usr/bin/time`).

Three conditions: **baseline** (no `RUSTFLAGS`, i.e. Cargo's default
`debug = true` / `-C debuginfo=2`), **debuginfo=1** (`RUSTFLAGS="-C
debuginfo=1"`, line-tables-only — keeps file:line resolution for backtraces
and panics, drops variable/type info), **debuginfo=0** (`RUSTFLAGS="-C
debuginfo=0"`, no debug info at all).

Each condition's first run in its own block was consistently ~1.7-2x its
later runs (baseline 79.66s vs. 40-42s; debuginfo=1 76.81s vs. 36.9-37.2s;
debuginfo=0 67.04s vs. 32.3-33.6s) — the same kind of box-noise/warm-up
outlier the 2026-09-16 report flagged, not a per-condition effect (it hit
every condition's first run alike). Excluded from the medians below. Two
further baseline/debuginfo=0 runs were interleaved (not batched) specifically
to check for an ordering confound, per the methodology lesson the 2026-09-16
report drew after finding one; direction and magnitude held.

## 📊 Assay

Wall clock, steady-state runs only (first run of each batched block excluded
as a warm-up outlier; see 🧪 Apparatus):

| Condition | runs (s) | median |
|---|---|---|
| baseline (`debug=true`, current default) | 40.03, 41.60 (batched) · 41.09, 38.97 (interleaved) | 40.56 |
| `-C debuginfo=1` (line-tables-only) | 36.88, 37.23 (batched) | 37.05 |
| `-C debuginfo=0` (none) | 32.30, 32.72 (batched) · 33.63, 33.56 (interleaved) | 33.14 |

Pooling all four baseline samples against all four debuginfo=0 samples (the
only pair run both batched and interleaved): median 40.56s → 33.14s, a
**18.3% reduction**. The batched-only pair alone reads closer to 20-21%; the
interleaved pair alone reads 15-18%. Read the honest number as ~18%, not the
more flattering batched-only slice — this report is not going to repeat the
2026-09-16 report's own first-draft mistake of citing the number that looks
best.

`-C debuginfo=1` alone reduces time by ~8.7% — real, but well short of the
20% floor on its own.

## 🔧 Why this is a findings report, not a fix PR

`-C debuginfo=0`'s ~18% reduction is close to, but on the honest pooled
number, just under, Onramp's own 20% impact-floor line — and line-count noise
this small on a shared 4-vCPU sandbox (the 2026-09-16 report measured
σ≈1.0-1.5s on this same class of box) means the true effect could sit on
either side of 20%. That alone would call for one more round of measurement
before shipping, on a dedicated or CI-caliber box rather than this shared
sandbox.

But the bigger reason this isn't a change to ship autonomously: **it degrades
the quality of a real, developer-facing debugging feature, even though it
doesn't break its documented contract.**

**Correction (thanks to review on PR #2829): the first draft of this section
overstated this as "regressing a documented field," which doesn't hold up
against the actual doc text.** `docs/guide/error-reporting.md:74-75` promises
only that `panic.backtrace` "is populated only when `RUST_BACKTRACE` is set,"
and `autumn/src/reporting.rs:413-417`'s panic hook calls
`Backtrace::capture()` unconditionally on that env var — nothing there checks
or depends on `-C debuginfo`, so the field stays populated exactly as
documented at every debuginfo level. What actually changes is quality, not
presence, and it's real: I built a throwaway two-function binary and compared
`std::backtrace::Backtrace::force_capture()` output at default debuginfo vs.
`-C debuginfo=0`. At default, every frame — including the crate's own
`inner`/`main` — prints `at src/main.rs:LINE:COL`. At `debuginfo=0`, the
crate's own frames print as bare function names with no `at ...` line at all
(`0: btcheck::inner`, no location), while precompiled standard-library frames
still resolve their location (they ship their own separately-built debug
info, unaffected by the local crate's flag). So under `-C debuginfo=0`,
`panic.backtrace` for a real Autumn app would still show the call stack's
function names — you'd still see *that* `my_app::handlers::checkout` panicked
and what called it — just without the file:line for any of those frames,
which is real information developers use ("which of these three call sites
hit this branch") and today get for free. `#[track_caller]`'s own
panic-location string (`"thread panicked at src/foo.rs:42"`) is separate from
`Backtrace` entirely and is unaffected either way.

**Correction (thanks to further review on PR #2829): this is not limited to
the application's own code.** A `[profile.dev]` override in the
generated-project's manifest is a Cargo profile setting, and Cargo profiles
apply to the whole resolved dependency graph by default (`[profile.dev.package.*]`
overrides are how you'd claw back debug info for specific crates, and the
templates set none). So `debug = 0` there would strip file:line from every
locally-compiled frame in a backtrace — the application's own code, and
`autumn-web` itself, and every other path/registry dependency compiled for
that build — not just the app's frames. Only genuinely precompiled
components survive, which in practice means the standard library's prebuilt
sysroot artifacts (the only thing the two-function experiment above actually
exercised) and nothing else; there is no intermediate tier of "your deps keep
their debug info, only your app loses it."

This is an undocumented quality trade-off, not a contract violation — but
it's still a real cost for every developer, on every build, forever, not just
the one-time cold-start build the gate measures, so it still belongs in front
of a human rather than shipped as a silent default change. Two additional
gaps would need closing before anyone could safely turn either level into the
templates' default regardless of that decision:

1. **This apparatus measured `-p autumn-web` in isolation**, not the actual
   `autumn new` no-DB daemon project `cold_start_driver.rs` builds (same
   `flash`-feature gap the 2026-09-16 report already flagged for its own
   apparatus) — the real gate's absolute numbers could respond differently.
2. **Only the cold build was measured.** A `[profile.dev]` override in the
   generated-project templates changes every subsequent `cargo build`/`cargo
   run`/`cargo test` too, including the warm, incremental rebuilds
   `dev-loop-latency.yml` and `dev-loop-scaling.yml` gate — not measured here
   at all, and debug-info emission cost does not necessarily scale the same
   way for a small incremental diff as it does for a from-scratch build.

## Decision needed

If a human wants to pursue this: pick a debug-info level for the generated
project templates' `[profile.dev]` (currently unset, so `debug = true`/full):

- `debug = 0` — larger win (~18%, pending re-measurement above the noise
  floor and against the real harness), but drops file:line resolution for
  every locally-compiled frame in a panic backtrace — the application's own
  code, `autumn-web`, and every other dependency Cargo builds from source for
  that project (function names still show; see the empirical check above,
  and the profile-scope correction just before this section) — a quality
  cost, not a broken contract, but a real and permanent one, and broader than
  "just the app's code."
- `debug = "line-tables-only"` — keeps backtrace file:line resolution intact,
  but only ~8.7% on this apparatus, short of the impact floor on its own.
- Do nothing, and let #2795's next attempt keep looking at the frontend/
  per-module side instead (would need `measureme`/`summarize` either
  pre-installed in CI's runner image or vendored, since `-Z self-profile`'s
  decoder needs `crates.io` access this sandbox doesn't have).

Not a "config option" in Onramp's banned sense (no new user-facing toggle —
this is picking a value for an existing Cargo profile key the templates
already leave at its default), but it is a debuggability trade-off worth a
named decision rather than an autonomous default flip.
