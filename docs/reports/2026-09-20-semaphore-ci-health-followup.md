# 🚦 Semaphore: CI health follow-up — first Tier 1 baseline for job_tracking (1/50), mechanism confirmed, deterministic fix

Follow-up to `docs/reports/2026-09-18-semaphore-ci-health-followup.md` and the
running investigation in `docs/ci-health/quarantine-ledger.md`. This pass
clears the hard gate for a Determinism PR on
`job_tracking_stores_integration::postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it`:
a Tier 1 same-commit rerun-rate baseline (1/50), a named mechanism confirmed
by reading the store's own source (not left as a hypothesis), and a rendered
test-vs-product verdict. The after-measurement is still outstanding — see
Measurement and Treatment — so this entry is not yet closed in the ledger.

## 🎯 Verdict path

Unchanged: `trunk-dev` is green; the required gate is `Test suite`
(`test-gate`), fed by `[test, trybuild, test-features, test-docker]`, plus
`Supply chain (cargo-deny)`. `manual-macos-contention-check.yml` remains
dispatch-only — still zero `workflow_dispatch` runs, now a **12th consecutive
idle pass** (~283 hours, past 11.5 days, since it became dispatchable
2026-09-08T15:07:44Z). Not dispatched this pass: new macOS CI spend needs a
human sign-off per this role's own rules, and no such sign-off is available
in this unattended run.

## 🌡️ Symptom

**The `job_tracking_stores_integration` harness result** (the headline of
this pass): `.github/workflows/manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml`, built by
the 2026-09-18 pass and merged the same day (#2845), was dispatched twice
against `trunk-dev`'s tip on 2026-09-18, before this pass started and not yet
folded into the ledger. Run 35364903427 failed at checkout (a malformed
`sha` input, 41 hex characters instead of 40 — zero iterations executed, not
a data point). Run 35365077413, redispatched two minutes later with a
corrected `sha`, ran to completion:

```
RESULT: 1/50 failed, 49/50 passed
```

The one failure, iteration 26 (`get_job_logs` on job 105665441315), panics
with the identical tracked signature — `"record should be past its
configured TTL"` at
`autumn/tests/integration/job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:264:5` — inside
a fresh testcontainers Postgres container built for that iteration alone.
This is a 2% same-commit rerun rate, the low-rate side of this role's own
≥20/≥50 sample-size split, and the harness delivered exactly the ≥50 samples
that bar calls for.

**Organic-hit sampling for the rest of the ledger's tracked corpus**
(2026-09-18T07:33:38Z exclusive to 2026-09-20T07:33:19Z, ~72h, two
`perPage=100` `pull_request`-event pages, 200 runs: 143 cancelled / 47
success / 10 failure) found **zero new hits** on any of `live_upgrade`'s
three signatures, `cache_stampede`, or `sim_fault_plan`. Of the 10 run-level
failures: 2 predate this window (already counted in the 2026-09-18 report);
2 are `dependabot/github_actions/dtolnay/rust-toolchain-1.120.0`'s own
action-pin bump breaking `MSRV (1.88.0)` and all three `Test (${{
matrix.os }})` jobs on that branch — that PR's own subject matter, unmerged,
so not affecting any other PR's CI; 2 are ordinary branch-owned `Clippy`
failures (`vesper/bugbash-2828-intentional-root`,
`claude/project-thread-bk4ejy` — the latter also fails `SQLite runtime`'s own
clippy step); 1 is `dependabot/cargo/validator-0.21.0` repeating its
already-documented `fuzz/Cargo.lock` staleness; 1 is
`vesper/macro-crate-split` repeating its already-documented
in-progress-refactor multi-job break. **Gap, noted rather than silently
closed**: `claude/stop-changelog-conflicts-0xp5f8` and
`claude/intelligent-wright-ebjkn4` were not individually triaged at job level
this pass — time-boxed in favor of following the job_tracking result through
to a fix — so they are not confirmed branch-owned, only unconfirmed against
the four tracked signatures by omission.

## 🔍 Diagnosis

**Mechanism, confirmed by source, not inferred.**
`PgJobTrackingStore::update` (`autumn/src/job_tracking.rs`) unconditionally
executes `UPDATE autumn_job_tracking SET record = ..., updated_at = $3,
expires_at = $4 WHERE key = $1` with `expires_at = now + ttl_secs` on
**every** call. Both lifecycle writes the running job triggers —
`mark_running` (once the job runtime picks the enqueued job up) and
`settle_success` (on completion) — route through this same `update`
unconditionally (confirmed via `run_job_handler_inner` in
`autumn/src/job.rs`). The test enqueues a job with `ttl_secs: 1`, reads the
record once, then sleeps a fixed 1200ms before asserting `expires_at <=
NOW()`. If either lifecycle write lands inside that 1200ms window — ordinary
job-dispatch latency, not contention or clock skew — it pushes `expires_at`
back out past the check point, and the assertion fires on a record that is
about to expire but hasn't yet.

This is exactly the "worker-refresh" mechanism this ledger's entry already
named as the better-supported of two candidates (the other, a discrete
clock step, was already demoted in an earlier pass via post-review
correction). Reading `update`'s body directly removes the hypothesis
qualifier: the refresh-on-every-write behavior is not inferred from
plausible code shape, it is what the method does.

**Test-vs-product verdict: test defect, not a product defect.** Refreshing
`expires_at` on every lifecycle write is deliberate, correct store
behavior — a job still being worked on should not expire out from under it.
The defect is in the test's assumption that nothing touches the record
between its initial read and a sleep whose duration it picked without
reference to when the job runtime would actually run the job.

## 🔧 Treatment

**Fix, in this pass's own PR — revised once during review (see Diagnosis
addendum below)**: `autumn/tests/integration/job_tracking_stores_integration.rs`'s
`postgres_backend_persists_tracked_job_and_expires_it` now configures a 10s
TTL (raised from the original 1s) and polls the tracked record (50ms
interval, 8s deadline) until `status` reaches a terminal value
(`"succeeded"`/`"failed"`) before starting the TTL wait, instead of sleeping
a fixed 1200ms from the initial enqueue-time read against a 1s TTL. Once the
job is terminal, `mark_running`/`settle_success` have made their last write
for that key (confirmed structurally: one `mark_running` call, one settle
call, `max_attempts: 1` on the `noop` job this test uses, no retry path).
Rather than sleep a further fixed guess, the test then queries Postgres for
the row's actual remaining TTL (`GREATEST(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (expires_at -
NOW())), 0)`) and sleeps exactly that plus a 300ms margin — correct
regardless of how much of the 10s TTL the completion wait already consumed.
This awaits the actual condition instead of widening a sleep to outrun an
unbounded dispatch latency, per this role's own standing preference.

**Diagnosis addendum — the first version of this fix had its own flake,
caught on review, not empirically.** A Codex review comment on PR #2867
pointed out that `PgJobTrackingStore::update`'s own `WHERE key = $1 AND
expires_at > $2` guard makes a lifecycle write a silent no-op once the row
is already expired. At the original `ttl_secs: 1`, a `mark_running`/
`settle_success` write delayed past one second by ordinary Docker-CI-runner
scheduler or database contention would find its own write vetoed — `status`
would stay `"pending"` forever, and the poll loop's original 5s deadline
would panic on a timeout that describes nothing about the TTL check itself.
That is a second, load-dependent flake, in a scenario where the *original*
fixed-sleep version would have passed. Fixed as described above (10s TTL,
8s poll cap, remaining-TTL-based wait) before this ever ran organically or
through another rerun campaign.

**Not touched**: the Redis sibling test (same file, lines 45-117) has the
identical race in principle — its own TTL write goes through the same
refresh-on-every-lifecycle-call shape — but has never produced an organic
hit, so it is left as-is rather than rewritten on no evidence of its own.

**Ledger updated**: `job_tracking_stores_integration` gets the full
2026-09-20 account above (baseline, mechanism, verdict, fix, and why the
entry stays open); `live_upgrade`/`cache_stampede`/`sim_fault_plan` are
unchanged (zero new hits, still uncampaigned pending
`manual-macos-contention-check.yml`'s still-outstanding dispatch).

## 📊 Measurement

| Item | Before this pass | This pass | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| `job_tracking_stores_integration` rerun rate | n=2 organic (2026-09-11, 2026-09-15), not campaigned | **1/50 (2%), CI-native, same commit** — Tier 1 baseline established | **Outstanding** — needs a post-fix dispatch (`iterations: "50"`) against `trunk-dev` once this PR merges; 0/50 closes the entry |
| Mechanism | Named as a hypothesis ("better-supported candidate") | Confirmed by reading `PgJobTrackingStore::update` directly | N/A |
| `live_upgrade` (3 signatures) | Uncampaigned | No new organic hits this pass | Unchanged |
| `cache_stampede` | Uncampaigned | No new organic hits this pass | Unchanged |
| `sim_fault_plan` | n=1, uncampaigned | No new organic hits this pass | Unchanged |
| `manual-macos-contention-check.yml` dispatches | 0 (11 idle passes) | 0 (12th idle pass, ~283h) | Needs human sign-off for CI spend |

**Revert check**: not run as a second rerun campaign (that would cost
another 50-iteration dispatch before this PR even merges). Structural
instead: the 1/50 result above already reproduces the exact race the fix
removes (iteration 26 failed while the old fixed-sleep code was live), so
the planned post-fix 0/50 is itself the before/after comparison — a clean
run after the fix, on a harness that has already shown it can catch the
failure, is the equivalent of the mutate-and-confirm-red step for a race
that isn't reproducible on demand by mutating the product (the race is
timing-dependent, not something a source edit can force to fire).

## 🔬 Reproduce

Confirm the harness result:

```
get_job_logs(owner=autumn-foundation, repo=autumn, job_id=105665441315,
             return_content=true, tail_lines=150)
# → "RESULT: 1/50 failed, 49/50 passed"
```

Find the failing iteration and its signature:

```
get_job_logs(owner=autumn-foundation, repo=autumn, job_id=105665441315,
             return_content=true, tail_lines=2000)
# grep for "FAIL" / "panicked" -> iteration 26, job_tracking_stores_integration.rs:264:5
```

Confirm the mechanism against source:

```
grep -n "fn update" autumn/src/job_tracking.rs
# read the method body: expires_at = self.expires_at(now) on every call
grep -n "mark_running\|settle_success" autumn/src/job.rs
```

Confirm the macOS harness is still undispatched:

```
actions_list(list_workflow_runs, owner=autumn-foundation, repo=autumn,
             resource_id=manual-macos-contention-check.yml,
             event=workflow_dispatch)
# → total_count: 0
```

Once this PR merges, the post-fix verification dispatch:

```
actions_run_trigger(run_workflow, owner=autumn-foundation, repo=autumn,
                     workflow_id=manual-job-tracking-rerun-check.yml,
                     ref=trunk-dev,
                     inputs={sha: "<trunk-dev tip>", iterations: "50"})
```
