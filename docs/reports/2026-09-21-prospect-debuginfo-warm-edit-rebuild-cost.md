# ⛏️ Prospect: is lower `-C debuginfo` a warm-edit rebuild win too, or cold-build-only? (pursue: -36% median vs 10% materiality line)

## 🎯 Question

The 2026-09-17 Onramp findings report
(`docs/reports/2026-09-17-onramp-devprofile-debuginfo-cold-start-findings.md`,
PR #2829, issue #2795) measured `-C debuginfo=0` giving a ~18% cold-start
build win (close to, but on the honest pooled number just under, Onramp's own
20% floor) and `RUSTFLAGS="-C debuginfo=1"` an ~8.7% win, but named two
explicit gaps before a human could decide which level (if any) to set in the
generated-project templates' `[profile.dev]`.

**Terminology correction (caught by Codex review on PR #2882): that report's
own prose calls its `-C debuginfo=1` condition "line-tables-only," but
`rustc -C help` on this same toolchain lists `line-tables-only` and `limited`
(the level numeric `1` maps to) as distinct values — "debug info emission
level (0-2, none, line-directives-only, line-tables-only, limited, or
full)". They are not the same setting.** Onramp's report measured `1`/
`limited`; this report's own first drafts inherited its "line-tables-only"
label and then, independently, set up an apparatus using the actually-named
`line-tables-only` Cargo profile value — a *different*, more minimal level
than the one Onramp measured. Both mistakes are corrected below: Onramp's
condition is called `limited` here, and this assay's original
`line-tables-only` condition is kept but no longer treated as the same thing.

Gap 2, verbatim: *"Only the cold
build was measured. A `[profile.dev]` override in the generated-project
templates changes every subsequent `cargo build`/`cargo run`/`cargo test`
too, including the warm, incremental rebuilds `dev-loop-latency.yml` and
`dev-loop-scaling.yml` gate — not measured here at all, and debug-info
emission cost does not necessarily scale the same way for a small incremental
diff as it does for a from-scratch build."

**Falsifiable question:** does a `[profile.dev]` debuginfo reduction change
warm/incremental Rust-route-edit rebuild wall-clock time — the same change
class the `RustRouteEditHello` dev-loop gate measures
(`autumn-cli/src/dev_loop_bench.rs:106-110`, budget p50 ≤3,000ms / p95
≤5,000ms / max ≤10,000ms) — by an amount that would matter to the pending
decision, or is the cold-start win a one-time, cold-build-only effect with no
bearing on the far more frequent warm-edit loop?

**Decision fed:** the same "Decision needed" pick the Onramp report deferred
to a human — which debug-info level, if any, to set in the generated-project
templates' `[profile.dev]` (issue #2795). This assay closes that report's
explicitly named gap 2. **Decider:** repo maintainer (same decider the
Onramp report named).

## ⚖️ Pre-registration

Committed to `/tmp/.../scratchpad/prereg.md` in this sandbox before the first
timed measurement (containment note below explains why that file isn't part
of this PR).

- **Materiality line, set before measuring:** |relative change in median
  warm-edit wall time, reduced level vs. baseline `debug=2`| ≥ 10% counts as
  **material** — a real factor the decision must weigh, in whichever
  direction it points. < 10% counts as **immaterial** — the warm loop is a
  wash and only the cold-start number matters. 10% was chosen because the
  existing `RustRouteEditHello` budget has real headroom on this box class (a
  single-digit-second p95); a change below 10% would not move a project
  meaningfully within that budget either way, while ≥10% is large enough to
  be a real, statable input to a human's decision.
  **Note added after measuring (not a change to the pre-registered line
  itself — see the correction in Apparatus): this line was, and remains,
  defined over compile-and-link wall time specifically, which is what this
  apparatus measures. Whether the real `RustRouteEditHello` gate's own
  end-to-end percentage (which also includes file-watcher and health-check
  latency this apparatus doesn't measure) clears the same 10% is a related
  but distinct question this assay does not answer.**
- **Conditions:** same sandbox/box class Onramp's report used (4 vCPU,
  rustc/cargo 1.94.1), `examples/hello` (path-depends on `autumn-web`), deps
  and `autumn-web` pre-warmed. Wall clock via `date +%s.%N` (no
  `/usr/bin/time` in this sandbox, same as Onramp's report).
- **Time box:** same session (target under ~45 min of wall-clock building).
- **Riskiest assumption first:** that debuginfo has *any* measurable effect
  on an incremental rebuild at all — a changed line in `hello`'s own 39-line
  `main.rs` only recompiles that one small crate; every dependency rlib,
  `autumn-web` included, is already built and cached. The a priori risk was
  that this whole lever is cold-build-only and the honest answer is a fast,
  cheap "no effect" — which is exactly the gap Onramp flagged as unmeasured.
- **Control:** baseline = current default (no override, Cargo's own
  `debug=true`/`-C debuginfo=2`) — same control definition Onramp's report
  used.
- **Containment:** local, uncommitted edits to `examples/hello/src/main.rs`
  and a temporary, clearly-marked `[profile.dev]` block appended to the root
  `Cargo.toml`, both reverted by the apparatus script before this report was
  filed (verified with `git status`/`git diff` after every run in this
  session). No CI or template changes; no production data; no dependency
  added.

## 🔍 Prior art

- The Onramp 2026-09-17 report itself (cited above), whose own apparatus and
  numbers this assay treats as the control condition's expected baseline
  shape and whose gap 2 this assay exists to close.
- The 2026-09-16 report
  (`docs/reports/2026-09-16-onramp-test-sim-compile-gate-negative-result.md`)
  supplied the methodology this assay reuses: exclude each block's first run
  as a warm-up outlier, and interleave condition order rather than batching,
  to guard against sandbox drift.
- No existing report measures warm/incremental rebuild cost under a
  `[profile.dev]` debuginfo override — this is new ground, not a re-dig.

## 🧪 Apparatus

Block design, not a flat interleave: an early probe (`RUSTFLAGS="-C
debuginfo=0" cargo build -p hello` on an already-warm build) took over two
minutes and rebuilt `autumn_web` itself from source — confirming that
changing debuginfo mid-session invalidates Cargo's fingerprint for the
**whole** dependency graph, not just the touched crate. Interleaving
individual builds by flipping `RUSTFLAGS` per-run, as this assay's first
draft script did, would have measured "cost of switching conditions," not
"cost of a warm edit under a fixed condition" — the wrong quantity, since a
real project is scaffolded at one debug level from `autumn new` and never
switches. Fixed design: each condition gets its own block — set
`[profile.dev].debug` in the root `Cargo.toml` (the actual mechanism the
decision is about, not `RUSTFLAGS`), pay one full-graph rebuild to enter the
block (excluded from the measurement — not representative of a real dev
loop), then take 3 timed single-line edits to `hello()`'s return string
(alternated to a fresh literal each time, so every sample is a real
recompile, never a no-op). Planned as two rounds with condition order
interleaved (baseline → `debug=0` → `line-tables-only` → `line-tables-only`
→ baseline → `debug=0`) to control for drift across the ~35-minute session,
matching the 2026-09-16 report's methodology — realized as planned for
baseline and `debug=0`, but not for `line-tables-only`; see the stub below
and the correction in **📊 Assay**. (A fourth condition, `debug=1`/`limited`,
was added afterward in its own separately-interleaved pair of blocks — see
the stub below and **📊 Assay**.)

**Stubs / shortcuts (the complete list):**
- Measures `cargo build -p hello` directly, not the actual `autumn dev`
  live-reload loop `dev-loop-latency.yml` gates (file-watcher trigger latency
  and the health-check poll after the binary restarts are not included).
  **Correction (caught by Codex review on PR #2882): an earlier draft of
  this stub claimed "only the relative delta between conditions" carries
  over to the real gate. That's not right either.** File-watcher and
  health-check latency, if debuginfo-insensitive and roughly fixed, still
  changes the *percentage* once added to the denominator — a toy example:
  4s→3s is -25%, but if a fixed 1s of overhead is added to both (5s→4s),
  the same 1s of absolute saving reads as only -20%. So every percentage in
  this report (including the ones that clear the pre-registered 10% line)
  is a **compile-and-link-time percentage**, not a validated claim about the
  full end-to-end `RustRouteEditHello` loop's own percentage — which could
  sit below this report's numbers, by an amount this assay did not measure
  or bound. What *is* comparable, and unaffected by this dilution concern,
  is absolute wall-clock savings for the compile step itself (real seconds
  removed from every warm edit), and the direction of every effect measured.
  Bounding or measuring the omitted watcher/health-check overhead is a
  concrete follow-up, not yet done here.
- Uses `examples/hello` (a workspace member of this monorepo), not the actual
  `autumn new`-scaffolded no-DB daemon project — same Onramp-flagged gap 1,
  still open, not closed by this assay.
- `[profile.dev]` was set at this workspace's root `Cargo.toml` rather than a
  generated project's own manifest (a workspace member can't carry its own
  `[profile]` table); a real generated project would set it in its own root
  manifest, with the same effect.
- One bug found and fixed mid-assay, disclosed rather than silently
  corrected: the first pass wrote `debug = line-tables-only` unquoted into
  TOML for the `d1` condition. That's an invalid manifest, so `cargo build`
  failed near-instantly every time and the apparatus's naive timer recorded
  the failure's ~30ms exit as a "successful" build — caught by eye (30ms is
  not a plausible compile time), not by the script, which had no exit-code
  check on that first pass. Fixed (quote non-numeric profile values, check
  `cargo`'s exit code, abort loudly on failure) and the `d1` condition was
  re-run in full before this report was written. `baseline` and `d0`'s
  first-pass numbers were unaffected (verified against a surviving build log
  showing a genuine `unoptimized` 2.40s build) and are used as-is.
- **That `d1` re-run cost this assay `line-tables-only`'s independent-block
  design (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, third round on the same
  paragraph): the rerun script ran `run_block 1 d1 ...` immediately followed
  by `run_block 2 d1 ...`, never returning to another condition in between,
  so the two logged "blocks" are one continuously-held measurement period,
  not two independent re-entries** — confirmed by the second block's own
  warm-up build taking 2.5s, not the ~200s a genuine fresh entry costs
  elsewhere in this apparatus, and by re-reading the rerun script itself
  (`warm_edit_d1_rerun.sh`, apparatus scratch, not committed — per
  Containment, apparatus never merges — but its logic is reproducible: the
  same `set_profile`/`run_block` pair the **🔬 Reproduce** section below
  gives, called twice in a row for the same condition with no other
  condition in between). `baseline` and `debuginfo=0` do not have this
  problem; only `line-tables-only` does. See **📊 Assay**/**🏁 Verdict** for
  what this does and doesn't allow this report to claim. (This specific
  measurement was later discarded and replaced with a properly-designed
  one — see **📊 Assay** — but is kept here, and the analysis of why it
  didn't work, as the record of what went wrong and why.)
- **`debug = "line-tables-only"` is not the same rustc setting as Onramp's
  `-C debuginfo=1` (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, fourth round):**
  see the terminology correction in **🎯 Question**. Rather than leave this
  as an unmeasured gap, a fourth condition — `debug = 1` (`limited`, the
  actual numeric level Onramp's report used) — was measured after this
  finding, with its own pair of genuinely independent blocks (interleaved
  with a fresh `baseline` pair, not with the other conditions above, since
  by this point in the session baseline/`debuginfo=0`/`line-tables-only` all
  had cached rlibs and could no longer force `limited`'s fingerprint out via
  a cheap switch — `baseline` was cheapest to alternate with). Its own
  paired baseline numbers are reported separately from the main table's, not
  pooled with them, because they came roughly 40 minutes later in the
  session and read measurably lower (see **📊 Assay**) — a real reminder
  that this sandbox's baseline itself drifts. **`debug=0` and `limited` are
  each compared against a baseline measured in the same narrow window as
  their own samples, and so, after two attempts, is `line-tables-only` — see
  the correction in **📊 Assay** for the history of why this took two
  tries.**

## 📊 Assay

Wall clock, steady-state runs only (each block's first run excluded as
warm-up; see Apparatus), n=6 per condition (2 rounds × 3 samples):

| Condition | samples (s) | median | mean | stdev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (`debug=2`, current default) | 4.022, 4.101, 3.951, 3.998, 4.096, 4.042 | 4.032 | 4.035 | 0.058 |
| `debug = 0` (none) | 2.630, 2.597, 2.622, 2.512, 2.584, 2.491 | 2.591 | 2.573 | 0.058 |

Relative to baseline median: **`debug=0` -35.75%** (paired: both `debug=0`
and this baseline came from the same continuous script run, interleaved —
see Apparatus).

**`debug = "line-tables-only"` is deliberately left out of the table above
and took two more attempts to measure validly, both caught by Codex
review on PR #2882:**

1. **(twelfth round)** Its original -37.39% divided a numerator from a
   later, separate rerun by this table's earlier-measured baseline —
   unpaired — and by the time that was caught, this report had already
   shown baseline drifting by 20-30% between some windows, not "a few
   percent" as an earlier draft claimed. Re-measured paired against a
   contemporaneous baseline with the pair order reversed between rounds:
   `line-tables-only` (round 1) → baseline (round 1) → baseline (round 2)
   → `line-tables-only` (round 2), giving -39.31%.
2. **(thirteenth round)** That fix broke a different way: the two
   *baseline* blocks in that sequence ran back to back with no intervening
   condition change — the identical continuously-held-state bug already
   found for the original `line-tables-only` rerun, just on the other
   condition this time. `line-tables-only`'s own two blocks were genuinely
   separated; baseline's weren't.

**Re-measured a third time, mirroring the pattern that worked cleanly for
`debug=0` and `limited`: simple alternation for two properly-separated
blocks each (both conditions' occurrences separated by a real intervening
entry to the other), plus one further single reversed pair as an
order-robustness check — the same two-part treatment already given to
`debug=0` and `limited`, rather than trying to fold both properties into
one clever sequence:**

| Condition (4th window, primary) | samples (s) | median | mean | stdev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `debug = "line-tables-only"` | 2.696, 2.761, 2.631, 2.606, 2.596, 2.622 | 2.627 | 2.652 | 0.064 |
| baseline (same window) | 4.834, 4.613, 4.240, 4.924, 4.043, 4.683 | 4.648 | 4.556 | 0.345 |

Relative to this window's own baseline median: **`line-tables-only`
-43.49%**. Block means (2 independent blocks each, alternating —
`line-tables-only`,baseline,`line-tables-only`,baseline, no two
same-condition blocks adjacent): `line-tables-only` = [2.696s, 2.608s],
baseline = [4.562s, 4.550s] — no overlap.

**On what "independent" means here (raised by Codex review on PR #2882,
fifteenth round): since the Reproduce section's own correction already
says a revisited condition reuses cached `target/` artifacts rather than
rebuilding from scratch, does that undermine calling the two blocks
independent?** No, and it's worth being precise about why, since the two
properties are different. Artifact *reuse* (the same compiled dependency
rlibs backing every sample of a given condition, first block and second
alike) is not a flaw here — it's expected and correct: every sample within
a condition should link against that condition's own consistently-built
artifacts, exactly as a real project would. What "independent" refers to is
*temporal/noise* independence — whether whatever transient system state
(a competing process, a momentary I/O or scheduling hiccup) affected one
block is decorrelated from what affected the other — which comes from real
wall-clock separation and a real, different condition's build happening in
between, not from whether `target/` was rebuilt from scratch. Both blocks
here have that: real time passed, and a real `baseline` build ran between
them. The one residual, unruled-out possibility this design doesn't
eliminate is OS-level page-cache warmth for the specific rlib files
themselves (block 2 relinking against files block 1 already pulled into
page cache, if they survived the intervening baseline build's own I/O) —
a real, if second-order, mechanism, and a fully rigorous design would use
an isolated `target/` per block to close it out entirely. But at the
effect sizes here (~35-45%, hundreds of milliseconds to seconds) it is not
a plausible sole explanation: relinking a few-MB-to-tens-of-MB rlib from a
warm page cache instead of a cold one is a millisecond-scale effect, not
the kind of gap these comparisons show.

| Condition (order-reversed single pair) | samples (s) | median | mean |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (leads this time) | 4.592, 3.872, 4.344 | 4.344 | 4.269 |
| `line-tables-only` | 2.758, 2.602, 2.569 | 2.602 | 2.643 |

Relative: **`line-tables-only` -40.10%** — consistent with the primary
measurement's -43.49% despite the reversed order. `line-tables-only` now
has the most thoroughly checked single-condition result in this report:
properly independent blocks *and* an order-reversal check, matching or
exceeding the rigor applied to `debug=0` and `limited`, and its three
successive measurement attempts (-37.39% invalid, -39.31% invalid,
-43.49%/-40.10% valid) all agree on direction and rough magnitude despite
each attempt's own methodology problem.

A fourth condition, `debug = 1` (`limited` — the actual level Onramp's
report measured as its own "`-C debuginfo=1`"; see the terminology
correction in **🎯 Question**), was measured separately, ~40 minutes later in
the session, against its own freshly-paired baseline rather than the table
above (this sandbox's baseline itself drifted between the two measurement
windows — see below):

| Condition (2nd window) | samples (s) | median | mean | stdev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (`debug=2`, re-measured) | 3.774, 3.860, 3.830, 3.698, 3.878, 3.758 | 3.802 | 3.800 | 0.068 |
| `debug = 1` (`limited`) | 2.815, 2.848, 2.823, 2.601, 2.778, 2.729 | 2.796 | 2.766 | 0.091 |

Relative to this window's own baseline median: **`limited` -26.45%**. Block
means (2 genuinely independent blocks each, interleaved
`limited`/`baseline`/`limited`/`baseline`): `limited` = [2.829s, 2.703s],
baseline (2nd window) = [3.821s, 3.778s] — no overlap, a clean separation
the same way the first window's baseline-vs-`debug=0` comparison was.

**Correction and robustness check (caught by Codex review on PR #2882,
tenth round): the sequence above is `limited → baseline → limited →
baseline` — `limited` is always the first condition in its pair,
`baseline` always second. Condition is perfectly confounded with
within-pair position, so a transition/cache/thermal/load effect tied to
"first vs. second in pair" rather than to the compiler flag could produce
the same pattern; non-overlapping block means don't rule that out on their
own.** Rather than leave this as a caveat, a third pair was run with the
order *reversed* — `baseline` first, `limited` second — later in the
session:

| Condition (3rd window, reversed order) | samples (s) | median | mean |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (position 1 this time) | 4.831, 5.006, 4.248 | 4.831 | 4.695 |
| `limited` (position 2 this time) | 3.492, 3.166, 3.750 | 3.492 | 3.469 |

Relative to this window's own baseline: **`limited` -27.72%** — consistent
in both direction and magnitude with the -26.45% from the original,
opposite-order pairing, even though this window's absolute baseline
(4.831s median) reads noticeably higher than either earlier window's
(4.032s, 3.802s) — this sandbox's baseline is evidently noisier across
widely-separated windows than the earlier "a few percent" characterization
suggested. That the *relative* effect held steady (-26.45% vs. -27.72%)
across both a reversed position and a substantially different absolute load
level is stronger evidence against a pure order/position artifact than
either single pairing alone would be. Not a full ABBA counterbalance (one
reversed pair, not a repeated one), so this doesn't fully retire the
concern — but it meaningfully reduces it, and this is now the strongest
warm-edit evidence in this report for any condition.

**Correction (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, fifth round): the first
draft of this paragraph called the -26.45% (warm) vs. -8.7% (cold) figures
"roughly three times" as if that ratio were itself a measured, meaningful
quantity. It isn't, and the claim is withdrawn.** Onramp's `-8.7%` number
comes from just 2 samples, both from a single batched block, of a
non-incremental full `autumn-web` crate build — unlike `baseline`/`debug=0`
in that same report, `debuginfo=1` never got the interleaved-block check
that would let anyone bound its own noise. And it's measuring a categorically
different workload from this assay's incremental single-crate `hello`
rebuild — different code being compiled, different compilation mode, no
shared apparatus. Matching the rustc setting (per **🎯 Question**'s
correction) makes the two numbers *comparable in kind*, not arithmetically
combinable into a ratio.

**What this assay's `limited` result does support, described honestly as
two separate observations rather than one derived ratio:** on the *cold*
build, Onramp measured `limited` giving a thin, weakly-replicated ~8.7%
saving, well under its own 20% floor. On the *warm* edit, this assay
measured `limited` giving a properly-replicated (2 independent blocks,
6 samples, no overlap with its own paired baseline, and reproduced at
~27.72% in a third, order-reversed pair — see the robustness check above)
~26-28% saving, well over this assay's 10% materiality line. Both numbers
stand on their own
apparatus's own footing; neither multiplies into the other. What they
jointly support is qualitative, not a multiplier: `limited` is not a
option whose benefit is confined to the one-time cold build, the way
Onramp's report's own framing (a real, if modest, cold-start win; an
open question everywhere else) might suggest — it has a separately-verified,
separately-large warm-edit win too.

**Correction (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, sixth round): this
report's earlier drafts repeatedly said Onramp's report "verified" or
"confirmed" that `limited` preserves backtrace file:line resolution. It
never did.** Re-reading Onramp's own empirical check
(`docs/reports/2026-09-17-onramp-devprofile-debuginfo-cold-start-findings.md:180-194`):
its throwaway two-function binary only compares default debuginfo against
`-C debuginfo=0`. The claim that `debuginfo=1` "keeps file:line resolution"
(that report's line 123) is asserted in prose, alongside the same
"line-tables-only" mislabeling this report's **🎯 Question** section already
corrected — not measured. So this report's own claim was borrowing
authority Onramp's report never actually had for this specific level.

**Rather than downgrade the claim to "unverified" and move on, this gap was
closed directly: the same throwaway-binary method Onramp's report used, run
in this sandbox at `-C debuginfo=1`.** The two-function `main.rs` this
tests (caught by Codex review on PR #2882: an earlier draft omitted this
source, so the check couldn't actually be reproduced or verified against
this exact frame layout):

```rust
fn inner() {
    let bt = std::backtrace::Backtrace::force_capture();
    println!("{bt}");
}

fn main() {
    inner();
}
```

```
$ rustc -C debuginfo=2 -o bt_default main.rs && RUST_BACKTRACE=full ./bt_default
   0: main::inner
             at ./main.rs:2:14
   1: main::main
             at ./main.rs:7:5
   ...
$ rustc -C debuginfo=1 -o bt_limited main.rs && RUST_BACKTRACE=full ./bt_limited
   0: main::inner
             at ./main.rs:2:14
   1: main::main
             at ./main.rs:7:5
   ...
$ rustc -C debuginfo=0 -o bt_none main.rs && RUST_BACKTRACE=full ./bt_none
   0: main::inner
   1: main::main
   ...
```

`debuginfo=1`/`limited` reproduces file:line resolution for local frames
identically to the full-debuginfo default (`at ./main.rs:2:14` in both);
`debuginfo=0` drops it entirely, exactly reproducing the asymmetry Onramp's
report found between default and `debuginfo=0` — just now with `limited`
actually placed on the map instead of assumed onto it. This is now a
genuinely confirmed result, by this assay, not a borrowed and mislabeled one
from Onramp's report.

**Correction (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, three rounds on this one
paragraph, about the original two-condition table only — the `limited` data
above came later and doesn't have this problem): draft 1 compared the
`line-tables-only`-vs-`debug=0` percentage delta directly against stdevs in
seconds — invalid, mixed units. Draft 2 fixed that with a Welch's t-test
treating all 6 samples per condition as independent — which round 2
correctly called pseudoreplication (3 samples within one block share that
block's warm-up/cache/thermal state) and which this draft redid at the block
level, treating each condition's 2 logged blocks as 2 independent units.
Round 3 caught that this was *still* wrong for `line-tables-only`
specifically: its "2 blocks" were produced by `run_block 1 d1 ...;
run_block 2 d1 ...` back to back in the rerun that fixed the TOML-quoting
bug (see Apparatus), with no other condition entered in between —
`set_profile` writes byte-identical `Cargo.toml` content both times, and
block 2's own warm-up build took 2.5s, not the ~200s a genuine fresh
re-entry costs (confirmed against `warm_edit_d1_rerun.sh`, apparatus scratch
described in Apparatus). So `line-tables-only` has **one**
independently-entered measurement period (6 back-to-back builds under
continuously-held state), not two, while baseline and `debug=0` each
genuinely do have two (separated by real intervening condition changes —
see the block order in Apparatus). That asymmetry means there is no valid
way to compare `line-tables-only` against `debug=0` at the block level
either: one side has 1 independent unit, the other has 2. The honest
statement is simply that this design cannot support a rigorous claim about
whether the two reduced levels differ from each other — not "no evidence of
a difference," not "within noise," just not measured with enough
independent repetition to say. (This is separate from, and doesn't affect,
the `limited`-vs-`debug=0` question, which this report doesn't address
either — `limited` was only measured against its own baseline, not against
`debug=0` or `line-tables-only`.) Onramp's cold-build report, by contrast,
found a large, clearly resolved gap between `debug=0` and `limited` (~18% vs
~8.7%) that this design flaw doesn't call into question.

This design flaw is why the original `line-tables-only` numbers were
discarded and re-measured (see **📊 Assay**) — that new measurement fixes
`line-tables-only`'s comparison *to its own baseline*, but does not create a
valid `line-tables-only`-vs-`debug=0` or `line-tables-only`-vs-`limited`
comparison: all three reduced conditions now have solid evidence against
their own contemporaneously-paired baseline, from three different windows,
which still is not the same as measuring any two of them against each other
in one shared window. That three-way comparison remains a real open item
(see **💰 Cost to productionize**).

**Correction (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, fourteenth round): an
earlier draft of this sentence compared `debug=0`'s and `line-tables-only`'s
sample ranges as if both still came from the same table/window — they
don't, since `line-tables-only` was moved out to its own properly-measured
window above. Restated with only what's still true:** in the main table,
baseline's sample range doesn't overlap `debug=0`'s (baseline min 3.951 >
`debug=0`'s max 2.630). The baseline-vs-`debug=0` comparison specifically
still holds despite the concerns above: both conditions were genuinely
independently entered twice (see Apparatus), and the effect size (~35%,
baseline block means 4.025s/4.045s vs. `debug=0`'s 2.617s/2.529s) is far
too large for plausible block-to-block noise to close.

**Robustness check (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, eleventh round):
this comparison has the identical order confound already found and checked
for `limited` — baseline is always first in its pair, `debug=0` always
second, in both real occurrences (see the block order in Apparatus). Rather
than assert this doesn't matter, it was checked the same way: a third pair,
order reversed (`debug=0` first, then baseline), run later in the session.**

| Condition (3rd window, reversed order) | samples (s) | median | mean |
|---|---|---|---|
| `debug=0` (position 1 this time) | 3.018, 3.062, 2.906 | 3.018 | 2.995 |
| baseline (position 2 this time) | 5.104, 4.942, 4.655 | 4.942 | 4.900 |

Relative to this window's own baseline: **`debug=0` -38.93%** — again
closely matching the original, opposite-order pairing's -35.75%, and again
under a substantially different absolute baseline level (4.942s median here
vs. 4.032s in the original window). Combined with the analogous check for
`limited`, both of this report's genuinely-block-designed comparisons have
now held up under order reversal — the strongest evidence in this report
against a pure position/order artifact driving any of its findings.

The original baseline-vs-`line-tables-only` pairings (the discarded -37.39%
and -39.31% figures, see above) each rested on their own independence or
pairing problem. Both are moot now — the final measurement above has
neither problem: 2 genuinely independent, alternating blocks, a
contemporaneous baseline, and its own separate order-reversal check.
All three baseline-vs-reduced-condition comparisons
in this report (`debug=0`, `line-tables-only`, and `limited`, each against
its own contemporaneously-paired baseline) are now a clean separation, not
a borderline call the way Onramp's cold-build `debug=0` number was against
its 20% floor.

**Worst case probed:** the warm-up (first-in-block) samples, deliberately
excluded from the tables above because they are not steady-state, are
themselves informative: `debug=0`'s and `line-tables-only`'s first-ever
entries cost 198.7s and 200.9s respectively (full-graph rebuild), and
`limited`'s cost 216.987s — confirming the one-time "switching tax" is real
and large across every reduced level measured, which is exactly why it's
excluded from a measurement about the *recurring* per-edit cost, not folded
in as if it happened on every edit.

## 🏁 Verdict

**Pursue** (material) — against the pre-set 10% line, measured over
compile-and-link wall time (see the correction in **⚖️ Pre-registration**/
**🧪 Apparatus**: this assay doesn't measure, and this verdict doesn't claim
anything about, the *full* `RustRouteEditHello` loop's own end-to-end
percentage, which also includes file-watcher and health-check latency):
every reduced debuginfo level measured changes warm-edit median
compile-and-link time by far more than 10% (`limited` ~26-28%, replicated
under reversed order; `debug=0` ~36-39%, likewise replicated under reversed
order; `line-tables-only` ~40-43%, likewise replicated under reversed order,
after two earlier invalid attempts were discarded — see below), the
opposite direction of the risk this assay was chartered to probe. This is not a
hidden recurring *cost* the Onramp report's open gap worried about — it is a
large recurring *win* on the compile-and-link portion of the far more
frequent warm loop, that stacks with the (borderline) one-time cold-start
win.

This changes the shape of the pending decision, not just its confidence:

1. **The trade-off is not "one-time cold-start win vs. permanent backtrace
   quality cost paid on every build,"** as the Onramp report framed it. It's
   "one-time cold-start win *and* a large, recurring per-edit win, vs. a
   permanent backtrace-quality cost" — the compile-time side of the ledger is
   bigger than Onramp's report alone showed, because most of a
   development session's builds are warm edits, not cold starts.
2. **`limited` (`debug = 1`, the actual level Onramp's report evaluated,
   and which this assay independently confirmed preserves backtrace
   file:line resolution — Onramp's own report only asserted this in prose
   and never measured it for `limited` specifically; see the correction in
   **📊 Assay**) is not confined to being a safe-but-marginal cold-start
   win — it has a separately-measured, separately-large warm-edit win too.**
   Onramp measured `limited` at ~8.7%
   on the cold build (from a thin, single-block sample of a different,
   non-incremental workload — see the correction in **📊 Assay**, this is
   not a number to build a ratio on). This assay measured the same setting
   at ~26-28% on the warm edit, from a properly-replicated, genuinely
   independent, interleaved design that also held up under a reversed
   measurement order (see **📊 Assay**) — trustworthy on its own terms, in a
   way the comparison in point 3 below isn't. The two
   numbers aren't combinable into a multiplier, but together they say
   `limited` is not a marginal, cold-build-only lever.
3. **Whether `line-tables-only` (an even more minimal, distinct rustc level
   — see the terminology correction in **🎯 Question** — that this assay
   measured separately and by coincidence, not because it was the level
   Onramp evaluated) beats `limited` on the warm-edit axis is still
   unmeasured, though for a narrower reason now.** `line-tables-only` now
   has its own solid, properly-paired, order-reversal-checked result against
   baseline (~40-43%, after two earlier invalid attempts — see the
   correction in **📊 Assay**), on par with or exceeding `debug=0`'s and
   `limited`'s own comparisons in rigor. But it was measured in its own
   window, against its own baseline, never head-to-head with `limited` in
   the same window — so there still isn't a valid
   `line-tables-only`-vs-`limited` comparison, just three separately-solid
   `condition`-vs-baseline comparisons that can't be safely subtracted from
   each other across windows. `line-tables-only`
   was also never directly verified (by this report or Onramp's) to
   preserve backtrace file:line resolution the way `limited` was — it
   likely does, since line tables are in the name, but that's an
   inference, not a measurement.

This still does not resolve the decision by itself — gap 1 (the actual
scaffolded no-DB daemon project, not `examples/hello`) remains open, and
Onramp's own `debug=0` cold-build number is still shy of its 20% floor
pending re-measurement above the noise floor. But it removes "we don't know
if this is a hidden recurring cost" from the open-questions list, and
replaces it with a specific, load-bearing number the decider can weigh for
the option Onramp's report actually evaluated for backtrace quality: `limited`
carries a large, validated recurring win, not just a marginal cold-start one.

## 💰 Cost to productionize

Not a new build — this assay feeds an existing decision (issue #2795) rather
than proposing new code. If the maintainer picks `debug = 1` (`limited`) for
the generated-project templates' `[profile.dev]` (the option with the
strongest evidence behind it: this assay independently confirmed it
preserves backtrace file:line resolution — Onramp's report only asserted
this in prose and never measured it for `limited` specifically, see the
correction in **📊 Assay** — and this assay adds a validated, large
recurring warm-edit win; both are measurements of the *same* rustc setting,
confirmed via `rustc -C help`): the change itself is the one line Onramp's
report already scoped (`autumn-cli/src/templates/Cargo.toml.tmpl`,
`Cargo.api.toml.tmpl`), plus the still-open items neither report has closed:

- Gap 1 (still open, either report): re-measure against the actual
  `autumn new`-scaffolded project via `cold_start_driver.rs`, not
  `examples/hello`/`-p autumn-web` proxies, before shipping a template
  default change.
- New: measure or bound the `autumn dev` live-reload loop's own
  file-watcher-trigger and health-check-poll latency, which this assay's
  compile-and-link-only apparatus omits — needed to know whether the real
  `RustRouteEditHello` gate's own end-to-end percentage clears 10% too, or
  is diluted below it by fixed, debuginfo-insensitive overhead (see the
  correction in **🧪 Apparatus**).
- Re-measure `debug=0`'s cold-build number above the noise floor / on a
  dedicated or CI-caliber box, per Onramp's report (only relevant if
  `debug=0` rather than `limited` is the level under consideration —
  `debug=0` does not preserve backtrace file:line resolution, confirmed
  empirically by both Onramp's report and this one).
- New: a `line-tables-only`-vs-`limited` warm-edit comparison measured
  head-to-head in one window, only needed if the decider wants to consider
  `line-tables-only` specifically instead of `limited` — both now have
  solid vs.-baseline evidence, but from three different windows (see the
  correction in **📊 Assay**), which isn't the same as measuring either
  against the other directly. `line-tables-only`'s backtrace-quality
  property is also itself unverified (by either report), unlike
  `limited`'s (see the empirical check in **📊 Assay**).
- Which build agents' gates: `cold-start-latency.yml` needs a green run
  against the new template default before it merges. **`dev-loop-latency.yml`
  does not yet give equivalent evidence for the warm-edit path — caught by
  Codex review on PR #2882, correcting this report's first draft, which
  wrongly treated a green run of it as validation.** Its `measure` job (not
  gated to PRs; scheduled/manual only) calls `autumn dev-loop-bench` without
  `--dry-run`, which reaches `dev_loop_bench::run`'s live branch — but that
  branch calls `build_placeholder_results` (`autumn-cli/src/dev_loop_bench.rs:455-459`),
  which computes every change class's stats from `compute_stats(&[])` (zero
  samples, so every field is `0`) and therefore always passes every budget.
  The live HTTP-polling measurement driver referenced in that function's own
  comment is not wired up yet. So today, a green `dev-loop-latency.yml` run
  is not evidence about a template default change — before shipping one, the
  live driver needs to exist (a separate, larger prerequisite this assay did
  not scope) or the change needs its own ad hoc measurement of the kind this
  assay performed, repeated against the real scaffolded project (gap 1,
  above). Keystone should be looped in before committing to a template
  default change either way, per its own architecture-review remit, since
  this is a permanent trade-off for every generated project, not a PR-level
  call.

# IMPORTANT (caught by Codex review on PR #2882, sixth round): this
# round-robin is a CORRECTED FOLLOW-UP DESIGN, not a literal replay of how

#   1. baseline -> debug=0 -> line-tables-only(buggy,discarded) ->
#      line-tables-only(buggy,discarded) -> baseline -> debug=0
#      (the buggy line-tables-only entries used unquoted TOML and never
#      really measured anything; see the stub in Apparatus)
#   2. A separate rerun, later: line-tables-only -> line-tables-only
#      (fixed TOML quoting, but back to back -- discarded, see the
#      pseudoreplication correction in Assay)
#   3. A separate run, later still: limited -> baseline -> limited ->
#      baseline, then (a fourth, reversed-order pair added after a
#      reviewer flagged the order confound below): baseline -> limited
#      -- see the robustness check in Assay
#   4. A separate run checking the debug=0/baseline order confound the
#      same way: debug=0 -> baseline (reversed from the main sequence's
#      baseline -> debug=0) -- see the robustness check in Assay
#   5. A separate attempt at a properly-paired line-tables-only
#      measurement: line-tables-only -> baseline -> baseline ->
#      line-tables-only (discarded -- the two baseline blocks ran back
#      to back with no intervening condition change, the same bug as
#      run 2 above, just on the other condition; see Assay)
#   6. The run that actually produced this report's final line-tables-only
#      numbers: line-tables-only -> baseline -> line-tables-only ->
#      baseline (alternating, both conditions properly separated), then a
#      fifth, reversed-order single pair: baseline -> line-tables-only --
#      see Assay
#
# TWO FURTHER CORRECTIONS on this recipe itself (caught by Codex review on
# PR #2882, tenth and twelfth rounds) -- the real run-5/run-6 mistake above
# (baseline's blocks landing adjacent) doesn't recur in the loop below,
# which was designed with that failure mode already in mind:
#
# 1. "Every block pays a genuine fresh re-entry" (an earlier draft's claim
#    here) is WRONG. Cargo keeps every profile fingerprint's build
#    artifacts in the shared target/ directory; set_profile only rewrites
#    Cargo.toml, never cleans target/. So only each condition's first-ever
#    visit in the whole session pays the ~200s full-graph rebuild --
#    returning to an already-visited condition reuses its cached rlibs
#    cheaply (seconds, not minutes), exactly what this report's own data
#    shows (compare the ~200s first-visit warm-ups in Assay's "worst case
#    probed" paragraph to every later revisit's few-second one). That's
#    fine for the "real condition change happened" argument (Cargo.toml's
#    content did genuinely change, and real wall-clock time and other
#    builds happened in between), but it is NOT "genuine fresh re-entry"
#    in the sense of a from-scratch rebuild, and a rigorous follow-up that
#    wants that property needs a clean target/ (or a fresh worktree) per
#    block, not just a manifest rewrite.
#
# 2. The round-robin below originally repeated the exact same order twice
#    (round 2 = round 1), which still confounds each condition with a
#    fixed position -- a systematic within-session drift (this report's
#    own baseline measurements varied a lot across widely-separated
#    windows) would bias every condition identically across both rounds
#    rather than cancel out. A first fix rotated round 2 instead of
#    repeating it -- insufficient (caught by Codex review on PR #2882,
#    twelfth round): a rotation changes which pairs sit next to each
#    other, but leaves each PAIR's internal order unchanged (baseline
#    still always immediately before debug=0, line-tables-only still
#    always immediately before limited, in both rounds) -- exactly the
#    two comparisons this recipe exists to make trustworthy. Fixed for
#    real below: round 2 reverses each pair's internal order relative to
#    round 1 (baseline-then-debug0 becomes debug0-then-baseline;
#    line-tables-only-then-limited becomes limited-then-line-tables-only),
#    so each compared condition leads its pair exactly once. Still only 2
#    rounds, not a full randomized design -- a follow-up wanting to fully
#    retire the order-confound question should add more, ideally
#    randomized, rounds:
for cond in "" 0 line-tables-only 1 0 "" 1 line-tables-only; do
  echo "== condition: '${cond:-baseline}' =="
  run_block "$cond"
done
