# ⚓ Ballast: weekly dependency ledger audit, 2026-09-28

Fourth Ballast pass, one week after the third
(`docs/reports/2026-09-21-ballast-dependency-ledger-audit.md`), which reran
the harness clean, corrected two of its own methodology claims mid-review,
and left nine open follow-ups. This pass reruns the harness end to end (same
methodology, same reproduce commands), re-checks every open follow-up, runs
a concrete rehearsal against the newest Dependabot PR in the queue (a
`jsonwebtoken` major bump, opened after last week's pass), and traces a real
mechanism behind this week's duplicate-version increase rather than just
reporting the delta.

## 🎯 Class

Ledger report. No dependency added, removed, bumped, or repinned.

## 📈 Evidence

**Harness re-run, all five graphs, `cargo-deny 0.20.2`** (installed fresh
this session — not present at session start — from the exact version
`ci.yml`'s `supply-chain` job pins):

```
./scripts/check-advisories.sh                 → OK, 0 unwaived advisories, all 5 graphs
./scripts/check-advisories.sh --self-test     → OK, RUSTSEC-2020-0071 blocked then waived, all 4 policies
cargo deny check licenses sources             → licenses ok, sources ok  (root graph)
cargo deny --config deny-sqlite.toml check licenses sources → licenses ok, sources ok  (SQLite graph)
cargo deny check bans                         → 84 duplicate-name warnings (warn-level; not CI-gated)
```

Identical clean outcome to all three prior passes on the advisories/licenses/
sources checks. `bans` moved (76 → 84), traced below — the first
duplicate-count movement any of the four passes has seen.

**Waivers, independently re-checked against current upstream state** (root
`deny.toml`'s three unique waivers, plus `island-flock/deny.toml`'s two —
`fuzz/deny.toml` repeats the root's `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` rather than adding a
new one):

| RUSTSEC id | Crate | 2026-09-21 | 2026-09-28 | Changed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RUSTSEC-2023-0071 | `rsa` | max stable 0.9.10, no fix (`0.10.0-rc.18` still RC) | max stable still 0.9.10 (`0.10.0-rc.18` still the newest release) | No |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0384 | `instant` | max 0.1.13, unmaintained | max still 0.1.13, unmaintained | No |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0253 | `lru` (via `aws-sdk-s3`) | pinned `aws-sdk-s3` 1.122.0; 1.123.0+ needs rust-version 1.91.0 | confirmed via `cargo info aws-sdk-s3@1.123.0`: still 1.91.0 (latest overall 1.150.0); 1.122.0 still the newest MSRV-compatible release under our 1.88.0 floor | No |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0370 | `proc-macro-error` (island-flock only) | max 1.0.4, unmaintained | max still 1.0.4 | No |
| RUSTSEC-2025-0141 | `bincode` (island-flock only) | reachability undetermined | still undetermined — `git log --since=2026-09-21 -- examples/island-flock examples/flock/static/islands` is empty, so there's still been no rebuild to inspect | No |

All five review-by dates are **2026-10-01 — now 3 days out**. See follow-up 1
for a timing gap this proximity surfaces for the first time.

**Graph facts, root workspace** (`cargo deny list --format json` for
node/name counts, `cargo metadata --no-deps` for the direct-dependency
count — kept as a separate, independently-sourced number rather than folded
into the `list`/`bans` question in follow-up 9):

| Metric | 2026-09-21 | 2026-09-28 | Δ | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unique crate@version nodes | 764 | 774 | +10 | see duplicate-version finding below |
| Unique crate names | 686 | 686 | 0 | — |
| Direct (non-dev) deps referenced by workspace members | 138 | 139 | +1 | `933097b` (#2938, merged 2026-09-24) named `pq-src` directly in `autumn/Cargo.toml`'s `db` feature (`>=0.3, <0.3.12`) to pin around a glibc-incompatible bundled-libpq release; previously only a transitive edge via `pq-sys`. Confirmed by reading the commit, not inferred from the count alone. |
| Workspace members | 37 | 37 | 0 | — |
| Duplicate crate names (`cargo deny check bans`, warn-level) | 76 | 84 | +8 | traced below |

**Duplicate-version increase, traced to a specific merged PR, not just
counted.** The 8 new duplicate names are exactly the servo HTML/CSS parsing
stack: `html5ever`, `cssparser`, `markup5ever`, `string_cache`,
`string_cache_codegen`, `phf_codegen`, `phf_generator`, `web_atoms`. Two
`autumn-web` dependencies pull two different major lines of this stack:

```
$ cargo tree -p autumn-web <deny.toml's full feature list> -e normal,build --target all -i html5ever@0.39.0
html5ever v0.39.0
└── css-inline v0.21.2 (mail feature)
    └── autumn-web

$ cargo tree -p autumn-web <same> -i html5ever@0.40.1
html5ever v0.40.1
└── ammonia v4.2.0 (markdown feature)
    └── autumn-web
```

Neither dependency changed its own `Cargo.toml` version constraint this
window — checked directly: root `Cargo.toml` still pins `ammonia = "4.1"`
at the workspace level (`autumn/Cargo.toml`'s `css-inline = { version =
"0.21", ... }` likewise unchanged), and 4.2.0 simply satisfies the existing
`^4.1` requirement. The split is upstream: PR #2889 (`chore(deps): bump the rust-deps group across 1
directory with 2 updates`, Dependabot, merged 2026-09-23) bumped `ammonia`
4.1.4 → 4.2.0, and ammonia's own changelog for 4.2.0 states "chore: upgrade
to html5ever 0.40.0" and "chore: upgrade to cssparser 0.38.0". `css-inline`
hasn't moved off the older html5ever 0.39.0/cssparser 0.37.0 chain. This is a
real, traced mechanism — a routine, already-reviewed-and-merged minor/patch
group bump (exactly the "scheduled batch" cadence this charter wants) had a
transitive side effect of widening the duplicate-version count by 8. Not
actioned: `[bans] multiple-versions = "warn"` is deliberately non-blocking
per `deny.toml`'s own rationale, and deduping would mean waiting on either
`css-inline` or `ammonia` to converge upstream, not something to force from
this side.

**Scheduled batch, all three graphs** (bare `cargo update --dry-run
--verbose`, reading the `Locking N packages to latest ... compatible
versions` line — never `--workspace`, which always reports 0 in this repo):

| Graph | 2026-09-21 | 2026-09-28 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| root (Rust 1.88.0) | 92 packages | 86 packages |
| `fuzz/` (Rust 1.88.0) | 66 packages | 71 packages |
| `examples/island-flock/` (no declared `rust-version`; this sandbox's 1.94.1 toolchain) | 31 packages | 31 packages |

Root fell (partially offset by this window's real merges — #2889, #2891
`infer` 0.16.0→0.22.0, and the `pq-src` fix). `fuzz/` also grew net of real
merged movement, not against a static baseline as an earlier draft of this
paragraph claimed: `git show --stat ba32d11 -- fuzz/Cargo.lock` and `git show
--stat 933097b -- fuzz/Cargo.lock` both touch it directly — #2891's own
regeneration commit message says so explicitly ("chore(deps): regenerate
fuzz/Cargo.lock for infer 0.22.0 — the Supply chain (cargo-deny) job runs
with `--locked` against the fuzz workspace, so the root bump has to carry
the fuzz lockfile with it"), and #2938 carries a matching "record the pq-src
edge in fuzz/Cargo.lock" commit. `island-flock/` held flat, and its
`git log --since=2026-09-21` is genuinely empty (verified the same way).
Ownership unchanged from all three prior passes: root is Dependabot's
territory (`directory: /`); `fuzz/` and `island-flock/` remain uncovered by
any *scheduled-batch* process (follow-up 7) even though `fuzz/Cargo.lock`
itself does get carried along by root-graph bumps that happen to touch a
crate it shares.

**Supply-chain facts, re-verified**: zero wildcard version ranges
(`grep -rn 'version = "\*"'`) and zero unpinned git refs (`git = "`) anywhere
in the tree, main workspace and both satellites — unchanged across all four
passes.

**Pain ledger — a real fire this window, already resolved before this pass
started.** `933097b` (#2938, merged 2026-09-24): `pq-src` 0.3.12
(libpq 18.6, published 2026-09-24) calls `timingsafe_bcmp`, which glibc does
not provide — every binary linking the bundled libpq failed with an
undefined symbol, breaking the scaffold gate on every PR and on `trunk-dev`
the same day the bad release shipped. Fixed same-day by pinning
`pq-src` to `>=0.3, <0.3.12` directly in `autumn-web`'s `db` feature (the
`+1` direct-dependency edge in the graph-facts table above). This is exactly
the "vulnerability you can reach is a fire" pattern the charter describes,
except the defect was a build break rather than a CVE — reached fast,
scoped narrowly, fixed same day, pin documented inline with a removal
condition ("remove when a fixed release is out"). Not a Ballast action
(already merged before this pass ran), but worth recording as evidence the
pain-ledger process the charter asks for is actually happening in practice.

**Dependabot open-PR queue, re-run with `is:open`** (`search_pull_requests`,
`author:app/dependabot is:open`): **11** open PRs, down from 13 last pass.
Three merged since 09-21 (`#2613` `actions/attest-build-provenance`, `#2792`
`taiki-e/install-action`, `#2179` `django`) — but only `#2179` was actually
flagged **stale** last pass (42 days then); last pass's own report described
`#2613` (14 days then) and `#2792` (7 days then) as new and explicitly "not
yet stale," so it would misstate that report to call all three stale here.
One new PR opened (`#2890`, `jsonwebtoken` 10.4.0 → 11.1.0, opened
2026-09-21, i.e. after last week's pass ran).

| PR | Title | Opened | Age today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1891 | `actions/checkout` 4→7 | 2026-07-13 | 77 days |
| #1894 | `tokio-tungstenite` 0.29→0.30 | 2026-07-13 | 77 days |

| #1899 | `rand` 0.9.4→0.10.2 | 2026-07-13 | 77 days |
| #2081 | `actions/upload-artifact` 4→7 | 2026-07-19 | 71 days |
| #2302 | `validator` 0.20.0→0.21.0 | 2026-08-24 | 35 days |
| #2615 | `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` 1.88.0→1.120.0 | 2026-09-07 | 21 days |
| #2890 | `jsonwebtoken` 10.4.0→11.1.0 | 2026-09-21 | 7 days |

The structural core sharing "no covering group at a major version" is
**nine** PRs, not eight — checked directly against `.github/dependabot.yml`:
`validator` (`#2302`) matches `rust-deps`'s `"*"` pattern (not excluded by
`axum*`/`diesel*`/`tokio`) the same way the other six Cargo majors do, and
0.20.0→0.21.0 is a pre-1.0 major transition under the same convention, so
`rust-deps`'s `update-types: [minor, patch]` excludes it from grouping for
exactly the same reason. The nine-PR structural core is 2 GitHub Actions
bumps (`#1891`, `#2081`) plus 7 Cargo semver-major bumps (`#1894`–`#1899`,
`#2302`) — unchanged and simply 7–8 days older, for the same structural
reason established over the last two passes: `dependabot.yml`'s
`github-actions` ecosystem defines no groups at all, and the `rust-deps`
catch-all group only covers `minor`/`patch` updates, so a pre-1.0 major
bump on a `rust-deps`-scoped package (or any `github-actions` bump) is
individual by design, not orphaned. Not something this pass acts on — a
human review/merge decision on each, same as every prior pass concluded.
Counting every PR in the table aged 21 days or older gives **ten**: the
nine-PR structural core plus `#2615` (21 days, the "ask before" toolchain
bump) — the same total as last pass's ten, but **not the same membership**:
`#2179` (part of last pass's ten) has since merged, and `#2615` (only 14
days old last pass, below its 28–69-day threshold then) has aged into this
pass's range in its place. The total held at ten by coincidence of timing,
not because the backlog stopped moving.

**New this pass — rehearsed the newest queue entry rather than only listing
it, since #2890 is exactly the shape of Upgrade this charter gates: a
semver-major bump with a live changelog to read.** `jsonwebtoken` 10→11 is a
plain stable-crate major bump (unlike last week's six 0.x "major" PRs), so
`rust-deps`'s `update-types: [minor, patch]` filter excludes it the ordinary
way, same mechanism, nothing new there. Rehearsed on a scratch copy of
`autumn/Cargo.toml` (`jsonwebtoken = { version = "10.1.0", ... }` →
`"11.1.0"`), `cargo update -p jsonwebtoken --precise 11.1.0`, inspected the
`Cargo.lock` diff, then reverted both files via `git checkout` before doing
anything else with them:

```
$ git diff Cargo.lock
 name = "jsonwebtoken"
-version = "10.4.0"
+version = "11.1.0"
 source = "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
-checksum = "eba32bf..."
+checksum = "e75fe14..."
 dependencies = [
  "base64 0.22.1",
  ...                      # every other dependency name/version identical
```

**Finding, part one: the lockfile diff changes nothing else in the graph.**
`rsa` stays at 0.9.10 under the `rust_crypto` feature Autumn already selects
— the `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` waiver's ingress path (`rsa 0.9.10 -> jsonwebtoken
-> autumn-web`) is untouched, so the hypothesis that this bump might close
that waiver (worth checking specifically, since it shares a review-by date
with this pass) is **false**, checked rather than assumed.

**Finding, part two: it does not compile — this pass's first draft got this
wrong and a Codex review comment on this PR caught it.** An earlier draft
cross-checked only v11's changelog *breaking-change list* (removed/renamed
APIs) against every `jsonwebtoken::` call site and, finding no match,
concluded the bump was "very likely a clean, low-risk compile." That check
missed an *additive* change: `jsonwebtoken::jwk::AlgorithmParameters` is
`#[non_exhaustive]` in 11.1.0, and `jwk_allowed_algorithms`
(`autumn/src/auth.rs:1447`, `#[cfg(feature = "oauth2")]`) matches it with
four arms and no wildcard. Reproduced directly, not taken on the cited
report's word: same scratch-copy rehearsal as before, then
`cargo check -p autumn-web --no-default-features --features oauth2`:

```
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `&_` not covered
   --> autumn/src/auth.rs:1447:11
    |
1447|     match &jwk.algorithm {
    |           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ pattern `&_` not covered
note: `AlgorithmParameters` defined here
   --> .../jsonwebtoken-11.1.0/src/jwk.rs:457:1
    = note: `AlgorithmParameters` is marked as non-exhaustive, so a wildcard
      `_` is necessary to match exhaustively
```

This exact break was already recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-09-22-semaphore-ci-health-followup.md` (CI run
35640495229 on the Dependabot branch itself, failing `Lint` and `MSRV`) —
this pass's own reproduction confirms that finding still holds against
today's `trunk-dev`, rather than assuming a six-day-old report is still
accurate. A second, related gap in the same earlier draft: rehearsing only
the root `Cargo.lock` is incomplete on its own, because `fuzz/Cargo.toml`
path-depends on `autumn-web` and `fuzz/Cargo.lock` is currently pinned to
`jsonwebtoken 10.4.0` — the advisory gate's `cargo fetch --locked` in
`fuzz/` would go stale exactly as that same CI run's `Supply chain
(cargo-deny)` job showed, so landing this bump needs `fuzz/Cargo.lock`
regenerated alongside the root one, not just the root.

So corrected: this PR is not a clean drop-in. It needs `jwk_allowed_algorithms`'s
match given a wildcard arm (a real source change, not just a version bump)
and both lockfiles regenerated, before it can build under the `oauth2`
feature at all — a materially different, and more useful, finding for
whoever reviews it than "no forcing fact found." Per the charter's
Upgrade-class bar, a major still needs a forcing fact beyond "staying
current," and none surfaced here (no advisory closes, no EOL/security-support
window applies) — but "no forcing fact" was almost the least important thing
this rehearsal found. **This PR stays a human review call, same as the other
seven major-bump PRs in the queue** — but now with an actual, reproduced
compile result attached instead of an assumption.

**Discrepancy from follow-up 8, re-observed via this pass's own `git push`,
and the count changed.** Last pass's `git push` printed "15 vulnerabilities
(2 high, 9 moderate, 4 low)" from GitHub's native Dependabot alert scan;
this pass's push of the report commit printed **"9 vulnerabilities (2 high,
7 moderate)"** — total down 6, moderate down 2, low down to 0, high
unchanged at 2. That move happened during a week where several Cargo
dependencies were genuinely bumped on `trunk-dev` (`ammonia` 4.1.4→4.2.0,
`infer` 0.16.0→0.22.0, `clap` 4.6.6→4.6.7, plus the `pq-src` pin) — but this
session has no tool to enumerate which of the 15 actually closed, so that
temporal overlap is exactly that and no more: it does not by itself
distinguish "some of the 15 were real GHSA-tracked Cargo advisories that
resolved when their vulnerable version left the branch" from "GitHub's alert
state or advisory data changed for reasons unrelated to this week's Cargo
bumps." Both remain open explanations. Not scored, per the same evidentiary
bar as last pass, and this time not leaned on either — the count change is
recorded as an unclassified fact, not evidence for either hypothesis, until
someone with Security-tab access joins the specific alerts against specific
merges. The two "high" alerts being unchanged across both counts is the one
piece worth a human's attention regardless of how the moderates moved.

## 💡 Mechanism / forcing fact

None, for Ballast to act on directly this pass — the fourth consecutive
pass reaching this conclusion. Every Tier-1 check reruns clean, every
existing waiver's underlying fact is unchanged, the one rehearsed Upgrade
candidate in the queue (`jsonwebtoken` 10→11) has no forcing fact *and*
does not currently compile under the `oauth2` feature (a real source fix
plus a `fuzz/Cargo.lock` regeneration are needed before it's even
buildable, not just "ask before"), and the open follow-ups are still open
human decisions (division of labor with Dependabot, satellite-graph batch
ownership, the NCSA license-class question, the GitHub-native alert-count
discrepancy).

## 🔧 Change

None to the dependency graph. This report is the only artifact.

## Follow-ups still open

1. **Timing gap surfaced for the first time this pass.** All five waivers
   share review-by date 2026-10-01 — now 3 days out. This weekly cadence's
   next scheduled pass lands 2026-10-05, four days *after* the review-by
   date, so nobody will actually look at these on the date itself unless a
   human (or an off-cycle pass) checks in between. Not actioned here — the
   charter says "revisit properly at that date, not before," and this pass
   is before it — but flagging the gap explicitly rather than letting the
   date quietly slip past between two weekly passes.
2. `examples/island-flock/deny.toml`'s `RUSTSEC-2025-0141` (`bincode`,
   reachability undetermined): still unresolved. `build-island.sh` has not
   rerun since at least the last three passes (`git log --since=2026-09-21`
   for that tree is empty), so there's still no natural point to inspect the
   compiled `.wasm`'s retained symbols. Still open.
3. The NCSA-via-`libfuzzer-sys` license-class decision for `fuzz/deny.toml`:
   still an open human "ask before" question, unchanged in `CHANGELOG.md`,
   `deny.toml`, and `fuzz/deny.toml` since the first pass.
4. Cost attribution (`cargo build --timings`) and a usage/unused-feature
   audit on the root graph's heaviest hires: still not run, fourth pass
   running. Deferred again for the same reason as before — nothing found
   this pass makes a specific candidate hire worth attributing cost to yet.
5. Human decision on how Ballast and Dependabot should divide
   responsibility (raised 2026-09-14, still open two passes later): no
   comment or config change found addressing it. This pass's `jsonwebtoken`
   rehearsal is a concrete example of the uncovered half — `ci.yml`'s
   `supply-chain` job already catches a new unwaived advisory or license on
   every Dependabot PR mechanically, but the reachability/forcing-fact
   judgment this pass just did by hand for one PR isn't run on the other
   ten automatically.
6. Open Dependabot PR queue: 11 (was 13), 10 of them 21–77 days old — the
   same *total* as last pass but **not the same PRs**: `#2179` merged out,
   `#2615` aged in (see evidence). The nine-PR structural core (2 GitHub
   Actions bumps, 7 Cargo semver-major bumps including `#2302`, corrected
   this pass) plus `#2615` makes the ten. Plus the new #2890 now rehearsed
   (see evidence). Still a human call whether to merge, close, or act on any
   of them; #2615 remains explicitly an "ask before" toolchain bump.
7. The `fuzz/` (71 packages) and `island-flock/` (31 packages) scheduled
   batches remain uncovered by any process — `dependabot.yml` unchanged
   since the decision was first raised. Same two options as every prior
   pass: extend `dependabot.yml` with two more directory entries, or have
   Ballast own satellite-graph batches on its own cadence. Still a human
   decision. `examples/island-flock/Cargo.toml` still declares no
   `rust-version` (re-checked: just `edition = "2024"`), so there's still no
   MSRV floor for its scheduled-batch row to be checked against.
8. **Still highest priority, and the count moved (cause unestablished).**
   GitHub's native Dependabot alert count for the default branch went 15
   (2 high, 9 moderate, 4 low) → **9 (2 high, 7 moderate, 0 low)** between
   last pass's push and this one (see evidence section). This session
   cannot attribute that move to this week's Cargo bumps or to anything
   else — no tool here enumerates which of the 15 closed, so the change is
   recorded as a fact, not linked to a cause. This session's GitHub MCP
   tools were checked again (`get_me`, `search_pull_requests`,
   `pull_request_read`, and a fresh `ToolSearch` for anything
   alert/vulnerability-shaped) and still none expose the Security tab's
   Dependabot alerts directly, so the 6 that closed and the 9 that remain
   (2 high) still can't be joined against this repo's waivers or its two
   non-Rust manifests (`examples/react-graphql/frontend/package-lock.json`,
   `benchmarks/runtime/django`'s Python deps) from this session. The two
   high-severity alerts being unchanged across both counts is worth a
   human's first look regardless of what explains the moderates moving.
   week.
9. The `cargo deny list` vs `cargo deny check bans` discrepancy flagged last
   pass (the former missed the `bitflags`/`parking_lot_core`/`parking_lot`
   chain that the latter found): re-tested this pass by re-running the same
   `-i bitflags@1.3.2` inverted-tree probe — the chain is still present and
   still correctly counted in this week's 84-duplicate `bans` output. That
   confirms no regression, but the actual open question (why `list` and
   `bans` can disagree at all — a `[graph]`/target-resolution difference
   between the two subcommands is the leading unconfirmed hypothesis) has
   not been investigated further this pass. Still open. **A second, adjacent
   instance surfaced this pass via a Codex review comment**: `phf_codegen`
   and `phf_generator` 0.11.3 exist in `Cargo.lock` (pulled by `terminfo` via
   `termwiz`/`ratatui-termwiz`, from `autumn-cli`'s `ratatui` dependency),
   but neither `cargo deny check bans` nor a plain `cargo tree -i
   phf_codegen@0.11.3` (workspace-wide, `--all-features`) reaches that edge
   — `bans` reports exactly 2 duplicate entries for each name (0.13.1,
   0.14.0), not 3. Re-verified directly (`cargo deny check bans | grep -A3
   "'phf_codegen'"`) before replying, so this pass's 76→84 attribution
   stands, but *why* a lockfile entry can exist outside every graph query
   this report runs against it is now two-for-two unexplained. Worth folding
   into whatever investigates the `list`/`bans` gap, since it may be the
   same underlying mechanism (a `[graph]`/target-resolution edge neither
   subcommand's default invocation walks).
