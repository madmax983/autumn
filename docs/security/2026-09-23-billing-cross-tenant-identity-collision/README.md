# 2026-09-23 — autumn-billing's session identity never carries the tenant

**Class:** cross-tenant read (and, via the hosted billing portal, potential
write) through an authenticated surface, via a plugin identity key missing
the tenant
**Surface:** `autumn_billing::gate::{session_user_id, user_id_in}`, consumed
by `SessionUser` (`routes.rs`: `checkout`, `portal`, `subscription`) and
`Entitled<R>` (`gate.rs`)
**Entry point:** `GET {prefix}/subscription`, `POST {prefix}/portal`,
`POST {prefix}/checkout`, and any app handler guarded by `Entitled<R>`
**Affected:** `autumn-billing` every release through 0.7.0, for any app that
combines `BillingPlugin` with Autumn's tenancy feature
**Status:** fixed — `autumn-billing/src/gate.rs`, `hooks.rs`, `model.rs`,
`store/mod.rs`, `store/memory.rs`, `store/db.rs`

## 🎯 Surface

`autumn-billing`'s quick start (`autumn-billing/src/lib.rs`,
`docs/guide/billing.md`) has an app mount `BillingPlugin` and gate a route
with `Entitled<R>`, or call the plugin's own `checkout`/`portal`/
`subscription` routes, all authenticated the ordinary way: a session cookie
resolved through `state.auth_session_key()`. Every one of those entry points
funnels through one function, `gate::session_user_id` → `user_id_in`, which
reads that session value and hands it straight to the billing store as the
customer's identity (`customer_by_user`, `CustomerUpsert::with_user`) with no
other qualification.

`BillingPlugin::resolve_store` always resolves `autumn_web::db::DbState::pool(state)`
— the app's one primary/control connection pool — never a per-shard one
(`autumn-billing/src/lib.rs:281`), so the `billing_customers` mirror lives in
one physical table regardless of how many tenants or shards the app has.

## 🕵️ Threat model

Against an app that follows Autumn's own documented, ordinary patterns —
mounts `BillingPlugin` exactly as its own quick start shows, **and**
separately turns on Autumn's tenancy feature with a `#[repository(tenant_scoped,
sharded)]` `User` model, exactly as `docs/guide/sharding.md` documents — an
attacker who is an **ordinary authenticated principal of tenant B** can
obtain **tenant A's billing state**: their subscription status and plan
entitlements (`GET /subscription`), and a **live hosted Stripe billing
portal session for tenant A's customer** (`POST /portal`, from which the
attacker could view tenant A's payment methods and invoices, and cancel
tenant A's subscription) — simply by being the second tenant to reach the
billing routes right after a shard-local id it happens to share with an
already-paying tenant A user. The app author did nothing the documentation
told them not to do: nothing in `docs/guide/billing.md` mentions tenancy at
all, and nothing in `docs/guide/sharding.md` mentions billing.

**Mechanism:** `docs/guide/sharding.md`'s own resharding runbook states that
"the destination's PK sequence" after a shard move must be reset "so the next
insert there won't collide with a shard-local `BIGSERIAL` id" — i.e. each
shard runs its own independent `BIGSERIAL` sequence, starting at 1. A
`#[repository(tenant_scoped, sharded)]` `User` model's row id is therefore
only unique **within its own shard/tenant**, not across the app. Two
different tenants' ordinary signup flows routinely produce a `User` with
`id = 7` on each shard — this is not a rare coincidence, it is the guaranteed
outcome of two shards both starting their sequence at 1. `session_user_id`
stringifies that id and hands it, unqualified, to a store shared by every
tenant, so tenant A's "7" and tenant B's "7" collide into a single
`billing_customers` row the instant either one starts a checkout.

## 🧪 Reproduction

Two new tests in `autumn-billing/tests/cases/routes.rs`, run through the real
HTTP entry points (`TestClient`, never a hand-built store row for the ACT
phase):

```
cargo test -p autumn-billing --test integration -- \
  subscription_does_not_leak_across_tenants_sharing_a_shard_local_user_id \
  portal_does_not_hand_a_hosted_session_to_another_tenants_customer \
  --nocapture
```

- `subscription_does_not_leak_across_tenants_sharing_a_shard_local_user_id`:
  tenant "acme"'s user "7" completes a real checkout and the provider's
  webhook confirms an active Pro subscription (the ordinary
  `docs/guide/billing.md` flow, run end to end). A **separate** app instance
  for tenant "widgets", sharing only the same billing store (modelling the
  one shared control-plane database two shards' web tiers both talk to),
  logs in its own, entirely unrelated user — who also happens to be "7" — and
  calls `GET /billing/subscription`.
- `portal_does_not_hand_a_hosted_session_to_another_tenants_customer`: same
  setup, but tenant "widgets"' user calls `POST /billing/portal`.

**Failure on trunk** (full output in `trunk-failure.txt`, committed in the
prior RED commit on this branch):

```
thread 'cases::routes::subscription_does_not_leak_across_tenants_sharing_a_shard_local_user_id' panicked at autumn-billing/tests/cases/routes.rs:791:9:
assertion `left == right` failed: tenant widgets' own unrelated user must not inherit tenant acme's paid subscription just because their shard-local user ids happen to collide as "7": {"entitled":true,...}
  left: Bool(true)
 right: false
```

```
thread 'cases::routes::portal_does_not_hand_a_hosted_session_to_another_tenants_customer' panicked at autumn-billing/tests/cases/routes.rs:820:9:
assertion `left != right` failed: tenant widgets must not be handed a hosted portal session for tenant acme's Stripe customer just because their shard-local user ids collide as "7" (got a redirect to Some("https://portal.fake/cus_seeded_7"))
  left: 303
 right: 303
```

Tenant widgets' brand-new, never-paying user was handed tenant acme's
`entitled: true` Pro subscription, and a live redirect into tenant acme's
Stripe billing portal.

## 🔎 Root cause

`autumn-billing/src/gate.rs`'s `user_id_in` (feeding `session_user_id`,
consumed by `SessionUser` and `Entitled<R>`) read the session's stored
identity and returned it verbatim, with no tenant component — unlike
`autumn/src/idempotency.rs`'s storage key, `autumn/src/security/rate_limit.rs`'s
bucket key, and `autumn-macros::cached`'s cache key, which all already fold
the ambient `CURRENT_TENANT` task-local into their storage identity for
exactly this reason. `autumn-billing` had no equivalent, and nothing in its
own docs disclosed the gap the way `autumn_web::auth::impersonation`
explicitly documents its own "same-tenant only" limitation with a real
`ImpersonationPolicy` escape hatch (see Blast radius).

## 🩹 Fix

`gate.rs`'s `user_id_in` now folds `CURRENT_TENANT` into the identity via a
new `scope_identity_to_tenant`, when a tenant is in scope, unchanged
(`user_id` verbatim) when tenancy is disabled or the route is
tenancy-exempt. Every billing store read and write already funnels through
this one function, so `checkout`, `portal`, `subscription`, and
`Entitled<R>` are all fixed together, and a non-tenant app's stored identity
— and its `billing_customers` rows — is byte-identical to before.

The identity is a length-prefixed encoding,
`{MARKER}{tenant.len()}:{tenant}{user_id}` (`encode_tenant_scope`), not a
bare `{tenant}{SEP}{user_id}` join — see Blast radius for why a plain
separator was tried first and is not injective once the tenant string itself
can contain the separator (`autumn_web::tenancy`'s `session`/`jwt` sources
place no character-set restriction on it). Length-prefixing makes the split
point unambiguous regardless of what either component contains, the same
reasoning `idempotency.rs`'s length-prefixed key components exist for.

Unhashed rather than hashed (unlike `#[cached]`'s tenant-folding, which
hashes) was deliberate: `Customer.user_id` is also handed to
`BillingHooks::recipient_for`, documented as "the application user id" and
default-implemented as `user_id.parse::<i64>()`. Hashing would have made the
original id unrecoverable and silently broken every tenancy-enabled app's
notifications. The default `recipient_for` now calls the new
`gate::strip_tenant_scope` before parsing, so it is unchanged in behavior;
see Compatibility for what a custom hook implementation needs.

## ✅ Verification

```

`./scripts/pre-push-check.sh`'s full-workspace `cargo test --workspace --no-run`
step hit this sandbox's disk allowance mid-build (compiling every example,
benchmark and plugin from a cold cache): the linker crashed with `Bus error`
on an unrelated example's test binary (`reddit-clone`'s
`commentable_pg_integration`) after the filesystem read 0 bytes free — an
environment resource limit, not a compile error in this change (`reddit-clone`
does not depend on `autumn-billing`). The narrower gates above cover the same
ground for a change confined to one leaf crate: `cargo check -p autumn-billing
--all-targets` (the cross-package compile-break class `pre-push-check.sh`
exists for) and the full `autumn-billing` test/clippy/fmt suite, both clean.

**CI caught a real gap in this fix**, not a flake: the "Migration guide
coverage" check's `check-docs-symbols.sh` gate failed on the migration
guide's own suggested diff for a custom `recipient_for` override, because it
referenced `autumn_billing::gate::TENANT_IDENTITY_SEPARATOR` — a
`pub(crate)` constant a downstream app cannot actually name. The migration
guide's advice would not have compiled for the exact reader it was written
for. Fixed by adding a public `autumn_billing::gate::strip_tenant_scope`
helper (used by the default `recipient_for` implementation too, replacing
its own inline `rsplit`) and pointing the migration guide's diff at that
instead of the raw separator, which also avoids exposing the separator
character as public API. Verified: `./scripts/check-docs-symbols.sh` now
reports 0 defects, and the full `autumn-billing` test/fmt/clippy suite
above stayed green after the change.

Re-attack attempts after the fix: reran both reproduction tests with the
tenant scope removed entirely (single-tenant mode) to confirm the identity
is byte-identical to pre-fix (no behavior change for non-tenant apps); reran
with the two tenants swapped (widgets pays, acme is the unrelated user) to
confirm the fix is symmetric, not an artifact of seeding order.

**Codex's automated PR review caught two more real gaps**, both against the
separator-based fix (commit `0d450a7`), reviewed and fixed here:

1. **P1 — the separator itself was not injective.** `autumn_web::tenancy`'s
   `session` and `jwt` sources place no character-set restriction on the
   resolved tenant string (`autumn/src/tenancy.rs`: both reject only an
   empty string after `trim()`), so a bare `{tenant}{SEP}{user_id}` join was
   not unambiguous: tenant `"a"` with user id `"b{SEP}c"` and tenant
   `"a{SEP}b"` with user id `"c"` folded to the identical string — the exact
   cross-tenant collision this whole fix exists to close, reopened by the
   fix's own separator. Fixed by length-prefixing the tenant instead
   (`{MARKER}{tenant.len()}:{tenant}{user_id}`, `autumn-billing/src/gate.rs`'s
   `encode_tenant_scope`/`strip_tenant_scope`), the same reasoning
   `idempotency.rs`'s length-prefixed key components already use, kept
   unhashed so the id stays recoverable. Verified with a new unit test,
   `gate::tenant_scope_tests::injective_even_when_a_component_contains_the_marker`,
   that reproduces exactly this collision and asserts the two encodings now
   differ (plus round-trip, embedded-colon, legacy-bare-id, and
   malformed-input-does-not-panic cases in the same module).
2. **P1 — no path to relink a pre-existing customer after enabling
   tenancy.** For an app that already had `BillingPlugin` mounted and
   *then* turned on tenancy, every existing `billing_customers` row keeps
   its old bare `user_id` — but the fix means every lookup now keys on the
   tenant-scoped form, so the row goes dark immediately, not
   "indistinguishably" as this ledger and the migration guide originally
   (incorrectly) characterized it. Worse, `upsert_customer` deliberately
   never replaces an existing link, so even a fresh checkout does not
   repair it — it silently creates a **second** provider customer instead.
   There was no existing store API that could fix this safely (an automatic
   fallback to the bare key would just reopen the collision this PR closes).
   Fixed by adding `BillingStore::relink_customer` — a new, explicit,
   overwrite-capable store method restricted to operator-driven migrations
   (never called from request-handling or webhook code), implemented for
   both `MemoryBillingStore` and `DbBillingStore`, returning
   `BillingError::Conflict` if the target id already links a different
   customer. Covered by three new `store_contract.rs` properties
   (`customer_relink_overwrites_existing_link`,
   `customer_relink_missing_customer_is_none`,
   `customer_relink_conflicts_with_existing_target`), which — per that
   file's own contract-suite pattern — run against `MemoryBillingStore` here
   and against `DbBillingStore` in `tests/mirror_db.rs`. The migration guide
   now gives the concrete relink recipe using the new
   `gate::scope_identity` + `store().relink_customer(...)` pair.

**A third, real gap** surfaced on the follow-up review round (commit
`bf088b20`), marked P2: `Billing::current_user`/`session_user_id` return the
tenant-scoped identity under tenancy, which `routes.rs`'s `customer_for` then
forwarded unchanged into `CustomerRequest.user_id` — the field
`BillingProvider::create_customer` receives, documented as "the application
user id" with no parse contract but still a real behavior change for any
custom `BillingProvider` that keys off it (a metadata-based lookup, a
welcome-email trigger keyed by the raw id, …). Unlike `recipient_for`, this
consumer is outside Autumn's own tenant boundary — Stripe (or a custom
provider) has no stake in the collision this fix exists to prevent — so
scoping it bought no security benefit while still being a compatibility
break. Fixed in `routes.rs`'s `customer_for` by calling
`gate::strip_tenant_scope` on `user_id` before building `CustomerRequest`,
so the provider sees exactly what it always has, tenancy on or off. New
test: `provider_create_customer_receives_the_raw_user_id_not_the_tenant_scoped_one`,
asserting the `FakeProvider`'s recorded `CreateCustomer` call carries `"7"`,
not the scoped form, under an active tenant scope.

This round also fixed a real CI failure the first fix round introduced:
`./scripts/check-docs.sh`'s `-D rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links` failed on
`strip_tenant_scope`'s (and two other `pub` items') doc comments linking to
the private `scope_identity_to_tenant` via `[`scope_identity_to_tenant`]`
intra-doc-link syntax — a public item's docs cannot link to a
non-`pub` one, since the target has no public doc page to link to. Changed
those three references to plain inline code text (no brackets); verified
with the exact CI command,
`RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links -D rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links" cargo doc -p autumn-billing --no-deps`.

**A fourth finding**, on the next review round (commit `2b46eedb`, P2): the
new `MemoryBillingStore::relink_customer` checked for a `user_id` conflict
*before* checking whether `id` even exists, so a missing `id` whose target
`user_id` happened to already be claimed by some other, unrelated customer
returned `BillingError::Conflict` instead of the documented `Ok(None)` —
`DbBillingStore`'s implementation already checked existence first (it reads
`current` by `id` before attempting the update), so the two backends
disagreed on this one edge case. A real cross-backend inconsistency an
operator's migration script could hit (e.g. retrying a relink after the
source customer was deleted). Fixed by checking `contains_key(id)` first in
the memory backend, matching the DB backend's order. New property:
`customer_relink_missing_customer_is_none_even_with_a_conflicting_target`,
run against both backends per `store_contract.rs`'s usual pattern.

**A fifth finding**, on the following review round (commit `f3c1b1a5`, P2):
`strip_tenant_scope` detects scoping by content, not provenance — it cannot
tell "genuinely produced by `scope_identity_to_tenant`" apart from "a bare
session id that already happens to start with `{MARKER}{digits}:`", since
the two are indistinguishable byte-for-byte (Codex's example:
`"\u{1}1:a7"` misparses to `"7"`, and also happens to be exactly what
`scope_identity("a", "7")` produces). This is judged a **known, accepted
limitation rather than a further fix**: closing it completely needs either a
typed identity carrying its own scoped/raw provenance (a breaking API
redesign well beyond this PR's scope) or rejecting the marker byte from
every session/tenant value at the source (which cannot apply retroactively
to a `user_id` an app already stored under `auth.session_key` before ever
adopting this crate — the same backward-compatibility constraint that ruled
out a full backfill in finding 2, above). Accepted specifically because
`TENANT_IDENTITY_MARKER` is a raw C0 control byte: every `user_id` shape
Autumn's own examples and `docs/guide/billing.md` produce — an integer
primary key, a UUID — structurally cannot contain one. Documented explicitly
on `strip_tenant_scope` (previously it undersold this as a clean
"safe to call unconditionally" no-op fallback) and covered by a named test,
`gate::tenant_scope_tests::known_limitation_a_bare_id_shaped_like_the_encoding_is_misclassified`,
so the gap is deliberate and tracked rather than a silent surprise.

**A sixth finding**, on the next review round (commit `556da2a2`, P1):
`relink_customer` was added to `BillingStore` as a **required** (non-defaulted)
method — a breaking source-compat change for any app supplying its own
`Arc<dyn BillingStore>` via `BillingPlugin::store` (a documented extension
point, not a hypothetical), whether or not that app uses tenancy at all. Only
`MemoryBillingStore`, `DbBillingStore`, and the test-only `FailingStore`
wrapper were updated; the Compatibility section's "no other implementor is
known" was an assumption, not something this PR could actually guarantee.
Fixed by giving `relink_customer` a default implementation that returns
`BillingError::Unsupported`, so a pre-existing external `BillingStore` keeps
compiling unchanged and gets a clear, documented error if something ever
calls the method on it, rather than a compile failure. New test in
`store_contract.rs`,
`relink_customer_default_is_unsupported_for_a_store_that_predates_it`, with
a bespoke `LegacyStoreWithoutRelink` implementing every other method — proof
this is source-compatible, not just an assertion in a doc comment.

**A seventh finding**, on the next review round (commit `1e91e8a4`, P1): the
migration guide's relink guidance was scoped too narrowly. It read as if
only an app *newly* enabling tenancy on top of existing billing data needed
to relink pre-existing rows — but every `billing_customers` row of **any**
tenancy-enabled app running `BillingPlugin` is a bare, unscoped id pre-fix,
regardless of whether tenancy was turned on yesterday or has run alongside
billing since day one (pre-fix, `Customer.user_id` was never tenant-scoped
either way — that's the entire vulnerability). An app that already combined
tenancy and billing before this release — the actively-exploitable
configuration this whole fix targets — would have read the guide, seen
"enabling tenancy" language that didn't describe its own situation, and
skipped the relink step, leaving every paying customer's row dark after
upgrading. Fixed by broadening the guide's wording (and the changelog
fragment's) to state plainly: every pre-existing row of every tenancy +
billing app needs relinking on upgrade, not only the "just turned tenancy
on" case. Documentation-only change; no code, so no new test — the
underlying `relink_customer` behavior was already covered by finding 2's
tests.

**An eighth finding**, on the following review round (commit `83cca9f4`,
P2): `Billing::current_subscription`, `is_entitled`, and `require` are
public methods taking a bare `user_id: &str` — a direct, documented way to
check entitlement outside the `SessionUser`/`Entitled<R>` extractor pattern
(a background job, a GraphQL resolver, an app's own auth middleware). Under
tenancy, `Customer.user_id` is now the tenant-scoped identity, but these
three methods do no scoping of their own — they pass `user_id` straight to
`customer_by_user`. A caller resolving "the current user" some way other
than `SessionUser`/`Entitled<R>` (which already route through
`session_user_id`) and passing that bare id here would silently miss an
otherwise-paying tenant user's row and deny entitlement, and nothing in the
migration guide said so. Considered making these methods auto-scope
`user_id` internally, but rejected it: a caller that already has the value
`current_user`/`session_user_id` returned (already scoped) would then get
**double**-scoped, breaking the common case to fix the uncommon one — the
same content-vs-provenance ambiguity as finding 5, just facing the opposite
direction. Documentation is the correct fix here, not a heuristic. Added the
contract explicitly to `current_subscription`'s doc comment (the method the
other two delegate to) and to the migration guide, and a new test,
`cases::gate::is_entitled_requires_the_tenant_scoped_id_directly_under_tenancy`,
demonstrating both the pitfall (bare id misses) and the fix (scoped id, via
the new `gate::scope_identity`, finds it) concretely rather than leaving the
contract only in prose.

A ninth and tenth finding landed in the same review round (commit `09b74d31`,
both P2):

9. **A concurrent webhook could undo a `relink_customer` migration.**
   `DbBillingStore::upsert_customer` read the row (`current`), mutated a
   few fields on that in-memory snapshot, and wrote the **whole row** back
   with `.set(&current)`. Every billing webhook reaches this upsert, even
   one with nothing of its own to change (email absent, already linked). If
   an operator's `relink_customer` call committed the new tenant-scoped
   `user_id` in the window between this upsert's read and its write, the
   whole-row write silently overwrote it back to the stale, pre-relink bare
   id — reverting the operator's own remediation, mid-migration, with no
   error raised anywhere. Fixed by replacing the single whole-row `.set(&current)`
   with two column-scoped `UPDATE`s: linking `user_id` only under a
   `WHERE user_id IS NULL` guard (evaluated by the database against the
   row's live state at write time, not this snapshot — the same
   compare-and-set pattern already used elsewhere in this file, e.g.
   `claim_dunning_attempt`), and a separate update touching only
   `email`/`updated_at` that never references `user_id` at all, so it can
   never be the write that reverts a relink. The final row is re-read after
   both writes rather than returned from the stale snapshot. Not
   independently regression-tested against a live race: reproducing the
   exact interleaving deterministically would need a test-only pause hook
   inside `DbBillingStore`'s own transaction, which is out of proportion for
   this fix. Confidence instead comes from the fix matching an established,
   already-relied-upon pattern in this same file, and from the full
   `store_contract.rs` non-racing suite (customer upsert/link/lookup
   properties) staying green against the refactored code.
10. **This ledger's own Compatibility section** had the same "enabling
    tenancy after" scoping bug the migration guide had in finding 7 — fixed
    identically, in the same commit.

**An eleventh finding**, on the very next review round (commit `415080c4`,
P2): finding 9's fix was one-directional. `DbBillingStore::relink_customer`
had exactly the same whole-row `.set(&current)` shape, just mutating
`user_id`/`updated_at` in memory while leaving `email` at whatever it read —
so a webhook's `upsert_customer` committing a refreshed `email` in the
window between `relink_customer`'s read and its write got silently erased
by `relink_customer`'s own whole-row write, the identical bug pointed the
other way. Fixed identically to finding 9: `relink_customer`'s write is now
column-scoped to just `user_id`/`updated_at`, never touching `email`, with
the final row re-read after the write rather than returned from the
snapshot. Same reasoning as finding 9 on why this isn't independently
race-tested against a live database.

Re-verified after all eleven findings: full `autumn-billing` lib tests (82),
`--test integration` (171), `--test mirror_db` (29), `cargo fmt`/
`clippy -D warnings` clean, `cargo check --all-targets` clean, the
documentation-build command above clean, and
`./scripts/check-docs-symbols.sh` / `check-migration-guides.sh` /
`check-plugin-surface.sh` / `check-changelog-fragments.sh` all still green.

(likely rare, since `docs/guide/billing.md` never mentions tenancy) case of
an app combining `BillingPlugin` with tenancy.

## 📜 Compatibility

- **Behavior change, tenancy-enabled apps only:** `Customer.user_id`, and
  therefore the string `BillingHooks::recipient_for` receives, is now an
  opaque, tenant-scoped identity rather than the bare session id. The exact
  wire format (length-prefixed, see Fix) is deliberately not public API and
  not documented as stable — only `strip_tenant_scope` and `scope_identity`
  are. Both `Customer.user_id`'s doc comment and
  `BillingHooks::recipient_for`'s are updated to say so.
- The **default** `recipient_for` implementation is unaffected: it now
  calls `strip_tenant_scope` before parsing, so `user_id.parse::<i64>()`
  succeeds exactly as before.
- A custom `BillingHooks::recipient_for` override that assumed the bare
  session id needs the same one-line change: call the new
  `autumn_billing::gate::strip_tenant_scope(user_id)` before parsing — but
  only if the app runs `BillingPlugin` under tenancy, which
  `docs/guide/billing.md` never documented as supported in the first place.
- **New public API:** `autumn_billing::gate::{scope_identity, strip_tenant_scope}`
  (build/recover a tenant-scoped identity explicitly, for operator tooling)
  and `BillingStore::relink_customer` (overwrite an existing customer's
  `user_id` link — see Fix). `TENANT_IDENTITY_MARKER` and the wire format
  stay `pub(crate)`.
- No config default changed, no route status code or response shape
  changed, no existing public function or trait method signature changed —
  `relink_customer` is additive to the `BillingStore` trait with a default
  implementation (`BillingError::Unsupported`), so an external implementor of
  that trait keeps compiling unchanged and needs to override it only if it
  wants to support the relink recipe (see finding 6, below).
- Non-tenant apps (tenancy disabled, the overwhelming majority of
  `autumn-billing` users per the docs) see byte-identical behavior.
- **Every pre-existing `billing_customers` row of every tenancy-enabled app
  running `BillingPlugin`** — whether tenancy was just turned on or has run
  alongside billing all along — must be relinked via the new
  `relink_customer`; see the migration guide. This was NOT true of the
  original fix's characterization ("indistinguishable in practice"); Codex's
  review caught first that the impact is immediate and the row does not
  self-heal, and again (finding 7, below) that the guidance itself was scoped
  too narrowly, describing only the "just turned tenancy on" case.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: fragment added at `changelog.d/billing-tenant-scoped-identity.md`.

## 🗂 Ledger

This directory: `trunk-failure.txt` (the RED run, committed in the prior
commit on this branch), `after.txt` (the GREEN run). No `queries.txt` or
`manifest-*.json`: the reproduction runs against `MemoryBillingStore`
(the plugin's own store-agnostic contract, matched by `store_contract.rs`
against both the memory and Postgres backends) through `TestClient`, not
against `autumn routes audit` or a live query witness — the vulnerability is
in application-level identity scoping, not in a query missing a tenant
predicate at the SQL layer (the store already binds whatever identity string
it is given correctly; the identity string itself was the bug).
