//! Shared support for issue #1192's per-example Chromium e2e smokes.
//!
//! Each example's smoke test spawns the example's **real, unmodified
//! binary** (built normally by `cargo build`, never re-registered
//! in-process) against ephemeral testcontainer Postgres, then attaches a
//! managed headless-Chromium [`SystemTest`] runner at its base URL via
//! [`SystemTest::attach`]. This runs `main.rs` exactly as a release would:
//! real routes, real builder chain, real auto-migration on boot — so a
//! regression in any wired-up feature (shard routing, primary/replica
//! split, mutation hooks, ...) is caught the same way a human clicking
//! through the app would catch it.
//!
//! Not published; workspace-internal tooling only (`publish = false`).
