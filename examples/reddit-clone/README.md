## Running

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL + Redis
docker compose up -d

# Run the app in dev mode
# The first boot applies the reddit-clone schema and starts the local job
# runtime plus the durable live-feed relay.
cargo run -p reddit-clone

# Optional: watch mode from the workspace root
# cargo run -p autumn-cli -- dev -p reddit-clone

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

The local job backend is the zero-config default. Registration enqueues
`user_onboarding` to award starter karma. Post submission enqueues
`post_publication` to refresh `hot_rank`, store a durable live-feed event, and
wake connected feed relays.

Inspect job state through the actuator:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/actuator/jobs
```

The live-feed relay exposes an operator-facing JSON snapshot:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/live/relay/health
```

## Redis Jobs And Live Feed

For a local Redis-backed queue and cross-process wakeup demo, use the checked-in
Redis profile:

```bash
docker compose up -d
AUTUMN_PROFILE=redis cargo run -p reddit-clone
```

That profile lives in `autumn-redis.toml` and configures:

- `jobs.backend = "redis"` for durable ad-hoc jobs
- `distributed.live_feed_bus.kind = "redis_pubsub"` for live-feed wakeups

The live WebSocket feed keeps the app database as durable truth via
`live_feed_events`, while the wakeup path is pluggable:

- Default/dev mode uses Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`
- Redis profile uses Redis pub/sub for cross-process wakeups
- Redis mode also keeps Postgres `NOTIFY` as a safety net, so missed Redis
  publishes still wake web nodes from the durable event log
- Polling is the last fallback when neither wake path is available

## Why This Example Uses Jobs Instead Of Harvest

Autumn Harvest is still the companion workflow engine for durable, multi-step
orchestration: workflow history, activity retries, timers, and dedicated
runners. This example uses Autumn Web's built-in `#[job]` runtime for the
registration and post-publication side effects because those are small
request-triggered jobs, not long-running workflows.

Keeping reddit-clone off `autumn-harvest` also keeps the release train clean.
Harvest depends on Autumn Web integration points; Autumn Web should not require
Harvest in a checked-in example just to publish a web release. See
[`docs/autumn-workflow-architecture.md`](../../docs/autumn-workflow-architecture.md)
when your app needs the heavier workflow machinery.

## Live Feed Operations

`/api/live/relay/health` reports the current relay state for the local process.
The important fields are:

- `listener_state`: which wake path is currently active (`postgres`, `redis`, `redis+postgres`, or `polling`)
- `reconnect_attempts` / `reconnect_successes` / `reconnect_failures`: whether the process is healing broken listeners
- `wake_redis`, `wake_postgres`, `wake_poll`: which path is waking the relay
- `replayed_events`, `last_seen_id`, `last_replayed_at`: whether durable rows are still flowing through replay
- `last_error`: the last relay or publish error seen by this process

Operator heuristics:

- Sustained growth in `wake_poll` means the process is living on fallback instead of a real bus.
- Growing `reconnect_failures` with a flat `reconnect_successes` means the configured wake path is still broken.
- A stale `last_replayed_at` while app writes continue means live updates are stuck before rebroadcast.
- In Redis mode, `listener_state = "redis+postgres"` is healthy: Redis is primary and Postgres is the backup wake path.

## WebSocket Live Feed

Connect to the live activity feed for real-time notifications:

```bash
# Global feed (all activity)
websocat ws://localhost:3000/ws/feed

# Subreddit-specific feed
websocat ws://localhost:3000/ws/r/rustlang
```

## API Endpoints

The `#[repository]` macro auto-generates read-only REST endpoints:

```bash
# Subreddits
curl http://localhost:3000/api/subreddits
curl http://localhost:3000/api/subreddits/1

# Posts
curl http://localhost:3000/api/posts
curl http://localhost:3000/api/posts/1
```
