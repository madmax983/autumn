//! Intentional error routes for smoke-testing the dev error overlay.
//!
//! These routes are registered only in the dev profile. In production they
//! return 404 (via the standard fallback handler). Contributors can hit them
//! to verify the overlay renders correctly without needing to introduce a bug
//! in application code.
//!
//! Visit http://localhost:3000/dev/trigger-error to see the overlay.
