# Verify that the determinism seam gate (issue #1797) is still armed and that
# nothing has quietly defanged it.
#
# THE DIVISION OF LABOUR (same as the #1611 panic gate)
#   clippy does the DETECTION. `clippy.toml`'s `disallowed-methods` array bans
#   `Instant::now` / `Utc::now` / `SystemTime::now` / `Uuid::new_v4`, and each
#   gated module re-denies the lint for its production code path via
#   `#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::disallowed_methods))]`. That runs in the
#   same `lint` CI job.
#
#   THIS SCRIPT keeps clippy able to see. It guards the manifest, the header
#   shape, the config, and the absence of any escape hatch that would let an
#   off-seam time read ship while `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` stays green.
#   It never greps for the banned calls themselves: clippy resolves `use ... as`
#   aliases and macro expansions that a grep cannot, and — decisively — clippy
#   does NOT see string literals, whereas a grep would flag the ~30 templated
#   `Utc::now()` occurrences inside `autumn-cli`'s code generators and the
#   `include_dir!`-embedded starter apps, which are generated-app text, not code.
#
# POLARITY (deliberately inverted from the panic gate)
#   `clippy::disallowed_methods` is warn-by-default and `clippy.toml` is
#   workspace-global with no level control, so populating the array arms the lint
#   everywhere at once. The workspace therefore GRANDFATHERS it
#   (`[workspace.lints.clippy] disallowed_methods = "allow"`, plus a package-level
#   `[lints.clippy]` table in each crate that does not opt into the workspace
#   table), and a module opts IN by carrying the gate header. The manifest below
#   is the enforced subset; MODULE_COUNT_FLOOR makes it a ratchet.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1.  Every manifest module exists and carries the `autumn-determinism-gate:`
#       marker.
#   2.  The marker is IMMEDIATELY followed (blank/comment lines aside) by the
#       gate header, and that header is structurally exact: after stripping
#       comments and whitespace it must read `#![cfg_attr(not(test),deny(` and
#       list every lint in REQUIRED_GATE_LINTS, with no `allow(`/`expect(`/
#       `warn(` of its own. A widened predicate such as `all(not(test), any())`
#       — whose deny never compiles — therefore fails.
#   3.  Tree-wide inner-suppression scan: no inner attribute (`#![allow(…)]`,
#       `#![expect(…)]`, or the `cfg_attr(…, allow(…))` form) anywhere under the
#       scan roots may re-permit a gate lint or a blanket group. Attributes
#       inside a `#[cfg(test)]` scope are exempt.
#   4.  Per-site allow hygiene: an OUTER `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods…)]`
#       in a gated module must carry a NON-EMPTY `reason = "…"`.
#   5.  Reverse manifest: every marker-carrying `*.rs` under the scan roots must
#       be listed in the manifest.
#   6.  Module-count floor: the manifest may not shrink below
#       MODULE_COUNT_FLOOR.
#   7.  Config completeness: `clippy.toml` still lists every path in
#       REQUIRED_CONFIG_PATHS, each with a non-empty `reason`, and still pins
#       `msrv`. Emptying the array would silently kill the gate while every
#       header stayed in place.
#   8.  No crate-local `clippy.toml`: clippy resolves its config from the nearest
#       ancestor of CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR and stops there, so a crate-local file
#       SHADOWS the root one entirely — disarming the ban and dropping the MSRV
#       pin with no diagnostic.
#   9.  The workspace grandfather line is present in the root `Cargo.toml`.
#       Without it the array arms every member and CI fails on hundreds of
#       pre-existing, out-of-scope sites — so someone would "fix" it by emptying
#       the array.
#   10. Feature reachability: a gated module behind a non-default Cargo feature
#       must have that feature enabled by an ENFORCING ci.yml clippy lane (one
#       that is not commented out and carries both `-p autumn-web` and
#       `-D warnings`), otherwise its deny block is never compiled.
#
# NOT covered: a banned call reached only through a `macro_rules!` expansion
# (clippy suppresses lints inside macro expansions), and the generated code
# `#[repository]` emits into a *downstream* crate — that expansion carries its
# own `#[allow]` with a reason and is named as a known-open gap in
# CONTRIBUTING.md "Determinism seam gate".
#
# Called from the `lint` job in ci.yml. Run locally with:
#
#     ./scripts/check-determinism-gate.sh              # self-test, then the real check
#     ./scripts/check-determinism-gate.sh --self-test  # synthetic fixtures only
#     ./scripts/check-determinism-gate.sh --check-only # real tree only
#
# The default invocation runs the self-test FIRST so a refactor that silently
# defangs this script fails here rather than years later on a real regression.
# No toolchain, no cargo, no network — the whole thing is under two seconds.

# Rewrite a Rust source file so that every check below reads CODE, not text.
#
# Line and (NESTING-AWARE) block comments are blanked to spaces; inside string,
# char, and raw-string literals every bracket — ( ) [ ] { } — is replaced with a
# placeholder byte. Line structure and byte offsets are preserved exactly, so
# line numbers stay meaningful.
#
# This is what closes four otherwise-fatal holes, each verified against the real
# tree before it was fixed:
#   * a gate header (or the whole marker + header) hidden inside `/* … */` was
#     extracted as if it were live code — so the gate could be commented out
#     while the script still reported OK;
#   * perl's non-greedy `/\*.*?\*/` does not nest, but Rust block comments DO,
#     so `deny(/* /* */ clippy::disallowed_methods */ clippy::correctness)`
#     flattened to text that *contained* the required lint while rustc saw a
#     header denying something else entirely;
#   * a `{` or `}` inside a string literal desynchronised the `#[cfg(test)]`
#     brace counter, and a `(` inside a `reason = "…"` string desynchronised the
#     attribute joiner;
#   * a lint named only in a comment counted as denied.
#
# Brackets are replaced rather than the whole string because the per-site check
# still needs to see `reason = "…"` and prove it is non-empty.
# NOTE ON APOSTROPHES: the perl program below is a single-quoted shell string,
# so a literal apostrophe anywhere inside it -- including in a perl comment --
# terminates that string. Keep perl comments apostrophe-free; explanations that
# need one live out here.
#
# Lifetime vs char literal: a tick is a LIFETIME (as in a reference with a named
# lifetime) unless the next byte opens an escape or the byte after that closes
# the literal. Getting this wrong is catastrophic -- a lifetime would swallow
# every byte up to the next tick in the file.
