# Reader-vocabulary gate: the page that documents a capability must carry the
# word a reader searches for it by.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: most of the corpus's docs gates answer the same shape of
# question — is what this page says TRUE?
# `scripts/check-docs-links.sh` gates its *links* (a 404),
# `scripts/check-docs-cli.sh` its *commands* (`unrecognized subcommand`),
# `scripts/check-docs-config.sh` the `AUTUMN_*` variables they SET (a silent
# no-op), `scripts/check-docs-toml.sh` the `autumn.toml` keys they WRITE
# (dropped silently), `scripts/check-docs-symbols.sh` the `autumn_web::…` paths
# they IMPORT (E0432 against their own file), `scripts/check-docs-routes.sh` the
# `/actuator/…` URLs they REQUEST (a 404 that reads like a feature they failed
# to enable), `scripts/check-docs-macro-args.sh` the macro keywords they TYPE,
# and `scripts/check-docs-scope.sh` that those gates agree on which pages are
# reader-facing.
#
# Every one of them presupposes a reader who ALREADY REACHED the page.
# `check-docs-orphans.sh` is the closest thing to an exception, and it asks
# whether a page is reachable by CLICKING — whether a link path exists from an
# entry surface. That is not the same question as whether a reader FINDS it.
# Nobody reads their way down a 150-page guide index looking for the page that
# answers them; they type the word they already have into a search box.
#
# `check-docs-retrieval.sh` asks that typing question too, and asks it more
# strictly: it models a search over a page's slug, H1 and headings, so a page
# passes only if it ANNOUNCES the reader's word, and its fixture pins one
# question to one answering page. This gate is the broader, weaker companion.
# It asks whether the answering page carries the reader's word AT ALL in
# rendered text — anywhere on it, heading or prose or table cell — and pins a
# capability to the vocabulary readers have for it rather than a question to a
# page. A page can satisfy this one and still fail that one, which is a real
# gap and not a redundancy: see the note above the table below.
#
# Either way a findability defect is silent in a way even a wrong sentence is
# not. A wrong
# sentence is at least READ. A page the reader never lands on produces no 404,
# no exit code, no ignored override, and no support ticket — the reader
# concludes the framework does not have the feature and goes and builds it
# themselves, or picks a framework whose docs answered them. The page can be
# perfectly accurate, freshly verified, owned, and linked from four places, and
# still fail every reader who calls the thing by its common name instead of its
# protocol name.
#
# THE BASELINE DEFECT, and why it is the shape of the whole class:
# `autumn generate auth User --totp` ships two-factor authentication —
# enrollment, login-verify, encrypted-at-rest secrets, recovery codes. It is
# documented in `docs/guide/authentication.md`, accurately and in detail. That
# page called it "TOTP" and "Multi-factor" and never once called it "2FA" or
# "two-factor authentication", which is what essentially everyone types.
#
# A corpus-wide grep for the reader's words returned four hits and not one of
# them was an answer:
#
#   README.md                            `…license-MIT%2FApache…`  <- %2F
#   docs/guide/step-up-authentication.md `…return_to=%2Faccount…`  <- %2F
#   docs/guide/rate-limiting.md          `POST /login/2fa`         <- an example
#                                        URL in a page about rate limiting
#   skills/generate/SKILL.md             "add TOTP two-factor auth" <- an agent
#                                        skill file, not a reader-facing page
#
# Two of the four were URL-ENCODED SLASHES. That detail is why this gate strips
# `%XX` escapes before it searches, and it is the reason the defect survived: a
# naive grep reports the term as "present in the corpus" and moves on. The
# term was present as punctuation.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE CHECKS, and what it deliberately does not:
#
#   For each entry in READER_VOCABULARY below, the NAMED PAGE must contain the
#   reader's word in its own text. Presence anywhere else in the corpus does
#   not satisfy the entry — that is the point. `POST /login/2fa` on the
#   rate-limiting page is a hit for the corpus and not an answer for the
#   reader, and an entry that could be satisfied from another page would have
#   passed on the exact state this gate was written to catch.
#
#   The table is DECLARED, not discovered, for the same reason
#   `check-docs-scope.sh` declares its differences rather than deriving them:
#   there is no mechanical way to know that "2FA" is the reader's word for
#   `--totp` and "tsvector" is not a word any reader types. A human decides
#   that once, writes it down, and the gate holds it. So this gate cannot find
#   a vocabulary gap nobody has noticed yet — it locks in the ones that have
#   been noticed, and gives the next one a place to be recorded. Adding a row
#   when you name a capability is the cheap half; the expensive half is the
#   reader who never arrives to tell you they didn't find it.
#

# (capability, page that documents it, TERMS — every one of which must appear)
#
# The terms are the READER's vocabulary, not the codebase's. A row earns its
# place when the two differ: `--totp` / "2FA" differ, and `rate-limiting.md` /
# "rate limit" do not. The rows where they agree are kept anyway as live
# tripwires — they cost one regex each and they fail loudly if a page is ever
# retitled into internal vocabulary.
#
# EVERY TERM IN A ROW IS REQUIRED, and that is the whole point rather than a
# detail. These started as one alternation per row, which meant any single
# alternative satisfied the entire row and the other terms were decorative: a
# row reading "2FA or two-factor" passed on "2FA" alone, so a reader typing
# "two-factor" was unprotected by a row that named their word. Readers do not
# search an alternation; they search one word, and the row has to hold for
# each word it claims.
#
# Consequently a LABEL MUST NAME EXACTLY WHAT THE TERMS ENFORCE. The earlier
# table failed this too, and more quietly: rows labelled "sign-up /
# registration" and "OAuth / social login" enforced only `\bsign[- ]?up\b` and
# `\boauth\b`. The label advertised a guarantee the pattern never made, which
# is the same defect as a docs page promising a feature it does not have. A
# term belongs in a row only once the page actually carries it.
#
# A single term MAY still spell one word several ways — `\bpassword reset\b|
# \breset password\b` is one reader term in two word orders, not two terms.
# The test is whether a reader would type one OR the other for the same idea;
# "2FA" and "two-factor" are the same idea and both get typed, so they are two
# required terms, not one alternation.
#
# KNOWN GAP, recorded rather than papered over. Satisfying a row here does NOT
# imply the page ranks for that word under `check-docs-retrieval.sh`, which
# searches only the slug, H1 and headings. The first row is the live example:
# `docs/guide/authentication.md` carries "2FA" and "two-factor" in its intro,
# its generator-flag table and its "where to go next" list — enough for this
# gate — while having no heading for the capability at all, so
#
#     ./scripts/check-docs-retrieval.sh --list
#
# still reports MISS for "2fa" and "two factor authentication" against that
# page if those rows are added to its fixture. Closing that needs a heading on
# the page, which is a change to the guide's structure and its anchors, not a
# change to this table. Until someone makes it, a row passing here means the
# word is ON the page, not that a search will rank the page for it.

    """Reduce a page to what a reader actually sees, then search that.

    THE RULE, stated once rather than as a list of special cases: a term counts
    only if it survives into rendered text. Everything removed here is the same
    defect — a byte sequence that satisfies a grep without ever reaching the
    reader — and the gate exists because the baseline defect was exactly that.
    A gate that counts invisible hits reproduces the bug it was written to
    catch, so the rule is applied generally instead of one construct at a time.

    Two categories:

      - **Markup that is not text.** HTML comments (this repo waives gates in
        them — `route-surface-allow` and friends), reference definitions,
        autolinks, link destinations, and HTML tags *including their
        attributes*. `<span id="2fa">TOTP</span>` shows the reader "TOTP"; the
        `id` is not on the page. Inner text and link text are kept, because
        those are what renders — this drops the tag, never what it wraps.

      - **URL escapes.** `%2F` is a slash. Left as-is it reads as a literal
        "2F" and makes `\b2fa\b` match `…%2Faccount…` and `…MIT%2FApache…` —
        two of the four corpus-wide "2FA" hits were punctuation. Substituting a
        slash removes the false hit and still separates the surrounding words,
        so a real term beside an escape keeps matching. This one applies
        everywhere, including code: a `%2F` in a fence is a URL escape there
        too, and matching "2FA" inside it is the same false positive.

    Code regions are carried through UNTOUCHED, because code renders: a term in
    a fence or a `span` is on the page and ctrl-F finds it. That is why the
    markup rules run per-segment rather than over the whole file — stripping
    tags inside a fence would delete text the reader can see.

    `_segments` decides which regions those are in a single ordered pass, so
    that "comments first" versus "code first" never has to be answered: the
    construct that opens first wins, as it does in a renderer.

    Three properties, each of which was true of the corpus at some point:

      1. A page that documents a capability without ever using the reader's
         word FAILS. This is the baseline defect verbatim.
      2. A `%XX` escape does NOT satisfy a row. `…path=%2FA then…` puts the
         letters 2, F, A between two non-word characters, so `\b2fa\b` matches
         it even with both boundaries anchored. That is a URL-encoded slash
         followed by a capital A, not the word a reader typed, and without
         `prose()` the gate passes on a corpus where the term appears nowhere.
      3. A page that does carry the word passes.
      4. A missing page is reported as a defect rather than crashing.

    Rows 1-3 inject both `read` and `exists`: a synthetic path does not exist
    on disk, so without an injected `exists` every one of them would return a
    "page does not exist" defect and the assertions would pass while proving
    nothing about the matching logic.
