# CLI coverage gate: every command `autumn-cli` ships must be written down
# somewhere a reader can find it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus carries twelve docs gates and every one of them
# runs in the same direction — docs -> code. `check-docs-cli.sh` asks whether
# the commands the pages name still exist, `check-docs-symbols.sh` whether the
# `autumn_web::…` paths still resolve, `check-docs-config.sh` whether the
# `AUTUMN_*` variables are still read, `check-docs-links.sh` whether the links
# still land. All twelve ask "is what we wrote still true?", which is DRIFT.
# None asks "is what we shipped written down anywhere?", which is COVERAGE.
#
# That asymmetry has a specific consequence: a command can ship, work, carry
# good `--help` text and good rustdoc, and be documented NOWHERE, and the whole
# gate tree stays green. It is invisible by construction — a gate that only
# reads the docs can never notice a command the docs never mention. The reader
# concludes the feature does not exist and goes and builds it themselves, which
# is the same outcome as an unreachable page (`check-docs-orphans.sh`) reached
# by a different route.
#
# The defect that prompted this ran exactly that way. All four `autumn token`
# subcommands shipped — `issue` since 0.5.x, `list` / `rotate` since 0.6.0 —
# and searching all 160 guide pages for "revoke api token" returned ZERO
# results. A reader holding a leaked credential had no path from the page that
# raised the question to the command that answers it. The prose half of that
# was fixed in #2821; the gate to hold the line was deliberately deferred there
# ("a correct one has to reuse `check-docs-cli.sh`'s `resolve()` rather than
# re-implement it, and that is its own change"). This is that change.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS: every command path in the surface is NAMED by at least one
# reader-facing page, unless it is exempt under a rule below.
#
# IT REUSES THE SIBLING GATE RATHER THAN RESPELLING IT. Surface, corpus and
# "which command does this line name?" all come from `check-docs-cli.sh`, via
# its `--list`, `--corpus`, `--resolved` and `--list-hidden` modes. This is not
# tidiness. A coverage checker that matches command paths against page text
# with its own regex gets the shallow cases right and the deep ones wrong, and
# every one of those wrong answers is a question `resolve()` already answers
# off the clap derive input with 866 self-tests behind it:
#
#   - `autumn openapi export`, documented in openapi.md, must NOT satisfy the
#     top-level `export` — a different command (an offline diagnostic
#     snapshot). A substring or suffix match says it does, and the top-level
#     `export` then reads as documented while appearing on no page at all.
#     That exact false negative was caught in review on the first attempt at
#     this gate.
#   - `autumn db pull posts` names `db pull`, not a subcommand `posts`.
#   - `autumn c` is a declared alias of `console`, and satisfies it.
#   - `autumn migrate --with-maintenance down` names `migrate down`; a matcher
#     that stops at the first `-` records only `migrate`.
#
# Asking the sibling cannot drift from its answer; modelling it can, which is
# the lesson `check-docs-scope.sh` already exists to enforce over the corpus
# definitions.
#
# ALIASES COLLAPSE ONTO THE CANONICAL COMMAND FIRST. `#[command(visible_alias
# = "c")]` makes `autumn c` another way to TYPE `autumn console`, not another
# command, and the sibling's surface lists both spellings as paths. Comparing
# spellings therefore demands that BOTH be documented independently, so a page
# that documents `autumn console` properly leaves `autumn c` looking
# undocumented — and the gate's advice would be to write the alias into the
# docs, which is the opposite of what a reader needs. Both sides are mapped
# through `--list-aliases` before anything is compared, segment by segment, so
# an alias at any level of a path collapses.
#
# This was latent rather than live when the gate landed: the corpus happens to
# write both `autumn c` and `autumn console`, which masked it. Rewriting the
# two `autumn c` lines to the canonical spelling reproduced it exactly —
# `defects: 1, autumn c`.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS COVERAGE. A command path is covered when some reader-facing
# page names it or names a DESCENDANT of it. A descendant covers its ancestors
# because a page writing `autumn token issue` has by definition written
# `autumn token` — the reader sees the group on the way past. The reverse does
# NOT hold: `autumn token` on a page says nothing about where `rotate` is
# documented, and treating a group as covering its children is how the four
# `token` subcommands stayed invisible while `token` itself looked fine.
#
# THE THREE EXEMPTIONS, each verified rather than trusted:
#
#   1. HIDDEN. `#[command(hide = true)]` keeps a command runnable but out of
#      `--help` — the author saying it is not a reader's to find. Read out of
#      the derive input (`--list-hidden`), so hiding a command exempts it with
#      no edit to this file, and un-hiding one re-gates it the same way. Today:
#      `serve run-service`, which `install-service` registers as the Windows
#      service command line and which does nothing useful run by hand.
#
#   2. THE `destroy` FAMILY RULE. `generators.md` states the reversal over the
#      whole family — "`autumn destroy <thing> <the same arguments>` reverses a
#      matching `generate`" — so a documented `generate X` documents
#      `destroy X` too, and repeating thirteen subcommands would be the
#      duplication that makes two copies drift apart.
#
#      The exemption is CONDITIONAL on both halves, and both are checked:
#      the rule sentence must still be on the page (delete it and all thirteen
#      report), AND `generate X` must itself be covered. That second half is
#      what keeps this from being a blanket waiver on the word `destroy`: today
#      `destroy inbound-mail` and `destroy policy` are NOT exempt, because
#      `generate inbound-mail` and `generate policy` are undocumented too, and
#      a rule that says "the same as generate" covers nothing when generate is
#      covered nowhere.
#
#   3. THE TRIAGED BACKLOG. The commands undocumented on the day this gate
#      landed, each carrying a reason. A backlog is how a gate lands on a
#      corpus that does not yet pass it; it is not a place to put new work. A
#      newly shipped undocumented command is NOT on the list and fails.
#
#      The list is exact in both directions. An entry earns its place only by
#      being the ONLY thing keeping its command out of the defect list, and it
#      fails the moment that stops being true — otherwise the list rots into a
#      set of waivers nobody can tell from live ones, which is how a baseline
#      file stops meaning anything.
#
#      "Documented" is not the only way it stops being true, and checking only
#      that was wrong. An entry is equally spent once ANOTHER exemption
#      accounts for its command, and leaving it there then defeats that other
#      exemption's own conditionality. Worked example, reproduced before it was
#      fixed: `destroy inbound-mail` is backlogged because `generate
#      inbound-mail` is undocumented. Document `generate inbound-mail`, and the
#      family rule takes over — the backlog entry is now dead weight, and
#      nothing said so. Delete the reversal sentence from `generators.md`
#      afterwards and the other eleven `destroy` subcommands re-gate while
#      `destroy inbound-mail` alone stays silently waived, by a line whose
#      stated reason ("stranded by `generate inbound-mail`") is no longer even
#      true.
#
#      So staleness is decided by asking what the gate would do WITHOUT the
#      backlog: whatever does not then land in `defects` is accounted for by
#      something else, whether that is documentation, `hide = true`, or the
#      family rule. That question cannot drift from the exemption rules,
#      because it is those rules, run again.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK: whether the page that names a command
# explains it WELL, or whether a reader searching their own words would land
# there. Those are real and they are not mechanically decidable; this gate
# answers the one question that is — is it written down at all? — and leaves
# the rest to the retrieval test.
