# CLI drift gate: every `autumn …` command the reader-facing docs tell someone
# to RUN must exist in the CLI.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus already gates its *links*
# (`scripts/check-docs-links.sh`) and its *rustdoc* intra-doc links
# (`scripts/check-docs.sh`), so a reader can no longer be sent to a page that
# does not exist. Nothing checked the other thing readers copy off a page: the
# command. `autumn-cli` carries 51 top-level commands and 174 command paths,
# the guide names them 2,400+ times, and a renamed or never-shipped subcommand
# leaves behind a line that looks exactly like a working one.
#
# The baseline run found `autumn migrate run` in three guide pages — a command
# that has never existed in `MigrateCommands` (`status`, `check`, `down`,
# `baseline`; the run action is the bare `autumn migrate`). One of the eight
# occurrences sat in a fenced `shell` block in `docs/guide/cloud-native.md`
# under "run the migration before deploying new workers", so the reader most
# likely to copy it was mid-production-upgrade. Clap answers with
# `unrecognized subcommand 'run'`, and — unlike a wrong sentence, which a
# reader can reason around — a command that does not parse is a dead end at
# the exact moment they cannot afford one.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (single fast job, no Rust toolchain needed):
#   1. The first token after `autumn` names a real top-level command — including
#      when the line is prefixed with environment assignments, which is how the
#      guide writes most production commands (`AUTUMN_ENV=prod autumn db backup`).
#   2. Each following token, while the command still has subcommands, names a
#      real subcommand of the path resolved so far. Options are walked THROUGH,
#      not treated as the end of the command, because clap accepts them before a
#      subcommand (`autumn migrate --with-maintenance down`). Whether an option
#      also eats the next token is read from the field's type in the derive —
#      `--force` (bool) does not, `--shard NAME` (Option<String>) does — so a
#      value is never mistaken for a subcommand, or a subcommand for a value.
#   2b. A command is recognised after a scalar key that means "a command
#      follows" (`command:`, `run:`, `Run:`), and the binary is recognised
#      however its path is spelled — `./autumn`, `/usr/local/bin/autumn`, or as
#      the value of a systemd `ExecStart=`.
#   3. A command whose subcommand clap REQUIRES is not left bare in a runnable
#      line. `autumn db` errors, and so does a bare `autumn` (the root takes a
#      required subcommand: `Usage: autumn <COMMAND>`, exit 2), while `autumn
#      migrate` — an `Option<>` subcommand — is fine. Checked only inside a
#      fence: in prose `autumn deploy` is how English names the command family
#      (49 times in this corpus) and `autumn` alone is just the binary's name,
#      so reporting those would bury the gate in false positives on correct
#      pages — and a gate people learn to ignore has stopped working.
#   4. The same, for a required POSITIONAL: `autumn replay` exits with "the
#      following required arguments were not provided: <CAPSULE>". Required
#      means only what clap cannot supply itself — a positional carrying
#      `default_value` is not required, and reading it as required reported 28
#      correct pages as broken (`autumn upgrade` defaults its `path` to "." and
#      the guide runs it bare 20 times) before that was caught by measuring.
#   5. Every OPTION the line passes is one that command declares. `autumn build
#      --release` is `error: unexpected argument '--release' found`, exit 2 —
#      the same dead end as a phantom subcommand, reached by the same reader
#      copying the same line. This was left out of the first version on the
#      grounds that a source-parsed flag set would be too noisy to gate; it was
#      then built and measured, and with four clap forms understood (below) the
#      corpus-wide noise was ZERO. The baseline found five real defects:
#      `autumn build --release` twice (the flag is `--debug`; release is the
#      default), `autumn dev --profile` (only `console`, `seed` and `task` have
#      it), `autumn setup --tailwind` (`setup` IS the Tailwind install, and
#      takes only `--force`), and — inside a copyable fence, commented
#      "explicit project path" — `autumn lifecycle check --path .`, where
#      `path` is a POSITIONAL and the line clap accepts is `autumn lifecycle
#      check .`.
#
#      Gating flags needs clap forms that gating commands did not, each of which
#      is a false positive — the gate telling an author to break a page that
#      works — if missed:
#        - `#[command(flatten)]`, so `graph impact` inherits `GraphArgs`'s
#          `--json` along with the other three `graph` subcommands;
#        - `trailing_var_arg`, so the six task arguments the guide documents
#          (`autumn task cleanup-posts --confirm`) are seen as forwarded to the
#          task rather than judged against the CLI;
#        - `allow_hyphen_values` on a POSITIONAL, so `autumn config set retries
#          -1` reads as the correct line it is. Counted, not flagged, so the
#          budget is spent and `--actorr` after it is still judged;
#        - clap's own `--help`/`-h`, present on every command and declared
#          nowhere in the derive input — but NOT `--version`, which
#          `#[command(version)]` puts on the root alone (nothing here sets
#          `propagate_version`, so `autumn migrate --version` is an error, and
#          a gate that vouched for it would be worse than no gate);
#        - a bracket-BALANCED read of `#[arg(…)]` (see `_arg_fields`), without
#          which every option whose attribute carries a list — five of them,
#          including `sbom --binary` and `upgrade --accept` — is invisible.
#      Options passed to the ROOT are resolved too, against a root node keyed
#      `''`: `autumn --help` and `autumn --version` are real lines in this
#      corpus, and without it `autumn --helpp` read exactly like them.
#      A token that starts with `-` is judged unless it carries prose
#      PUNCTUATION — the corpus writes arrows (`0.5.0 -> 0.6.0`) and
#      slash-joined shorthand (`autumn token issue --name/--scope/--expires-at`)
#      in command position, and neither is a line anyone can copy. The filter is
#      never by canonical spelling: requiring `--[a-z-]+` dropped exactly the
#      misspellings this exists for (`--show_config` for `--show-config`).
#
# Both `requires_sub` and the required-positional COUNT were validated against
# the built binary's `--help` usage strings across all 173 command paths: exact
# agreement, no mismatch in either direction.
#
# The OPTION model was validated the same way, by running the built binary and
# reading its exit code rather than reasoning about clap's parser. Every row
# below was measured, and the gate agrees with all of them:
#
#   exit 0  autumn --version · replay --help · db --help · deploy --help · db -h
#           replay -h · replay -hpapi · replay -hx · routes /admin --help posture
#   exit 2  migrate --version · --version=foo · replay --help=foo
#           test --reset=true · routes --user-only=yes · routes /admin --methd POST
#           config set retries 3 --actorr · replay -xh · replay -zz
#   accepted (exit 1, parsed then failed for want of a project/database)
#           test --nocapture · test --package blog · test --reset · test --nope
#           config set retries -1 · routes /admin --method POST
#
# Run those from an EMPTY directory: a line clap accepts then fails at runtime
# exits 1, so exit 2 cleanly means "the parser rejected it". Do not run them in
# a real project — `autumn test --reset` drops the test database, and
# `config set` writes to a live one.
#
# Nothing here adds a build dependency: the gate still parses the derive input
# and runs in seconds with no toolchain. The binary is how the MODEL is checked
# when a question turns on clap's behaviour rather than on the source.
#
# TRUTH SET: parsed from the clap derive input in `autumn-cli/src/**/*.rs`, not
# from a checked-in snapshot. A snapshot is one forgotten regeneration away
# from gating the docs against a CLI that no longer exists, which is the very
# failure this script is for. Parsing the source keeps the truth set correct by
# construction: rename a command and the gate moves with it in the same commit.
# The parser handles the four forms this CLI actually uses — `Variant`,
# `#[command(subcommand)] Variant(SomeCommands)`, `Variant { #[command(subcommand)]
# action: Option<SomeCommands> }`, and `Variant(SomeArgs)` where the args struct
# carries the subcommand — plus `#[command(name = "…")]` renames and
# `visible_alias`/`alias` (without which the real `autumn c` reads as drift).
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK:
#   - Whether an option's VALUE is one the command accepts. `--format yaml`
#     against a `value_enum` of `text|json` is a real defect and is not gated:
#     the accepted set lives in a separate enum per option, and unlike a flag
#     name there is no single derive site to read it from. Names first.
#   - Anything after an option the command does not declare. The walk stops
#     there — reporting the flag, but not guessing whether it ate the next
#     token — so a subcommand written after a bad flag goes unjudged. It is one
#     defect per line either way, and the line has to be fixed regardless.
#   - Tokens past the point where the resolved command has no subcommands.
#     `autumn db pull posts` is a positional table name, not a subcommand, and
#     the parser records which commands take positionals so those tokens are
#     not mistaken for drift.
#   - Prose mentions. Only fenced shell blocks and inline code spans are read —
#     the two places a reader copies from. "run autumn migrate to apply" in a
#     sentence is not a copyable line, and scanning prose drags in every
#     "autumn is", "autumn never", "the autumn crate".
#
# WHAT IS NOT EXTRACTED, ON PURPOSE. The corpus was swept for every line in a
# copyable context naming `autumn <word>` that this script yields nothing for.
# 38 lines remain, and every one of them was resolved by hand against the parsed
# surface: none names a command that does not exist. So the list below is a
# latent gap, not a live defect, and widening the pattern to reach it would add
# regex surface and false-positive risk for zero defects found today:
#   - Program output quoted back at the reader: banner lines (`🍂 autumn
#     doctor`), log records (`[autumn routes] warning: …`), `--help` transcripts
#     (`Scaffold one with:   autumn new <name> --starter …`), tree diagrams
#     (`└─ autumn build --embed`). These are what the tool PRINTED, not what the
#     reader types, and gating them would make every log line in the guide a
#     hostage to the CLI's argument spelling.
#   - Shell comments inside a block. `shlex` strips them, so `# Run migrations
#     first (autumn seed will error …)` is prose behind a `#`, not a command.
#   - A command split across a prose line wrap OUTSIDE a code span (`… roll ONE
#     back with `autumn deploy` / `rollback --only <host>``, where the wrap
#     falls between two separate spans). A span that wraps INSIDE its backticks
#     is read — markdown renders it as one span, and missing that hid a live
#     `autumn migrate run` in migrations.md behind a `\n> ` break.
#   - An ARBITRARY prose prefix. A bounded set of scalar keys that mean "this is
#     a command" — `command:`, `run:`, `entrypoint:`, `cmd:`, `exec:`,
#     `script:` — IS read, since Compose writes `command: autumn migrate`, a
#     workflow step writes `run: autumn routes`, and the skills write `Run:
#     autumn migrate` as an instruction. An earlier version of this script
#     lumped those in with arbitrary prefixes and skipped all 14; the reasoning
#     was right about arbitrary prefixes and wrong about these, which are the
#     keys whose whole meaning is that a command follows.
# Wrapper forms that ARE extracted, because they are unambiguous command
# positions rather than prose: after a `--` separator (`kubectl exec deploy/app
# -- autumn …`), inside a quoted wrapper argument (`fly ssh console -C "autumn
# …"`), and after env assignments whose value is a command substitution
# (`AUTUMN_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key) autumn …`).
#
# HOW A LINE IS READ. The line is TOKENIZED as shell (`shlex`), then reasoned
# about as tokens. It got there the hard way: the extraction started as one
# anchored regex and was widened five times — chains, environment prefixes,
# `--` separators, quoted wrappers, continuations — with each widening having to
# re-state the ones before it, and the fifth silently breaking the fourth. Every
# remaining defect after that was the same root cause, ad-hoc shell parsing:
# an operator inside a quoted value cut a command in half, a space inside one
# ended validation early, a closing quote stayed glued to the last word. `shlex`
# is in the standard library and settles the class, so quoting is no longer a
# case this file reasons about at all.
#
# On the token stream:
#   - operators (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&`) separate commands — and cannot do so
#     from inside a quoted value, which is the point;
#   - a quoted option value is ONE token however many spaces it contains, so a
#     subcommand written after it is still judged;
#   - `#` starts a comment, so a shell comment naming a command needs no special
#     case;
#   - a command is recognised at the head of a segment (after any prompt and any
#     environment assignments, whose values may be quoted or `$(…)`), after a
#     `--` separator, or as a single token that is itself a command line — which
#     is how a quoted wrapper argument (`-C "autumn …"`) tokenizes.
# Before tokenizing, backslash continuations inside a fence are folded into one
# logical line, so a command path broken across a line break is still read (the
# defect is reported at the line the command starts on). A line that does not
# tokenize — an apostrophe in prose, an unbalanced quote in a transcript — falls
# back to whitespace splitting rather than being dropped: less accurate, never
# worse than before.
#
# CORPUS SCOPE: reader-facing task docs only — `docs/guide/`, `docs/migrations/`,
# `skills/`, `agents/`, and the root `README.md` / `EXAMPLES.md` /
# `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `STABILITY.md`. Deliberately excluded:
#   - `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/releases/` — a historical record. What was true
#     at 0.7.0 must stay written as it was; correcting history to satisfy a
#     gate is how a changelog stops being evidence.
#   - `docs/plans/`, `docs/stories/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/reports/`,
#     `docs/design/` — planning artifacts whose job includes naming commands
#     that do not exist yet (`autumn harvest migrate`) or were rejected
#     (`autumn scaffold sync`). Gating them would make the gate a tax on
#     writing a proposal.
#
# WAIVERS: a reader-facing page sometimes has to name a command that does not
# exist — "`autumn generate island` does not exist yet" is a real answer to a
# real question. Waive it with a marker directly below the passage that names it:
#
#     <!-- cli-surface-allow: autumn generate island — planned, see #493 -->
#
# The same marker waives one FLAG of a command, by naming it after the command:
#
#     <!-- cli-surface-allow: autumn build --release — release is the default -->
#
# That form is matched by its own pattern, and first (see `FLAG_WAIVER`): the
# command pattern's separator alternatives include `--`, so it reads the line
# above as the command `build` with the reason `release — …`, waiving a whole
# command where one flag was meant. Separate a flag waiver's reason with `—` or
# `:`, never `--`.
#
# The marker sits in the page beside the claim, so when the sentence is deleted
# or the command ships, the waiver goes with it. A central allowlist would
# outlive both. Every waiver must carry a reason after the command.
#
# A waiver is scoped two ways, because a broad one is worse than none — it
# silently re-admits the defect the gate exists to catch:
#   - It NEVER applies inside a fenced shell block. A page may *name* a command
#     that does not exist; it may never hand one to a reader to run. This is the
#     rule that keeps a waiver from undoing the `system-tests.md` fix, where a
#     planned command sat inside a runnable block.
#   - It covers only its own blank-line-separated block and the one directly
#     above it — the passage it was written for. The same command spelled wrong
#     further down the page is still reported.
#
# USAGE:
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh              # gate the corpus
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --list       # print the parsed command surface
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --list-options  # …with each command's options
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --list-hidden   # …only the `hide = true` ones
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --list-aliases  # alias -> canonical spelling
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --corpus     # the reader-facing pages it reads
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --resolved   # which command each line names
#   scripts/check-docs-cli.sh --self-test  # synthetic-corpus tests
#
# The last three exist for `scripts/check-docs-scope.sh` and
# `scripts/check-docs-cli-coverage.sh`, which ask this gate for its corpus,
# its surface and its reading of a line rather than respelling any of them.

# either direction is a false positive: skip too little and `json` in
# `autumn routes --format json` reads as a bad subcommand; skip too much and a
# real subcommand after a boolean flag goes unchecked.
#
# The attribute body is BRACKET-BALANCED rather than regexed. It was regexed
# (`#\[arg\(([^\]]*)\)\]`), and a character class that cannot cross a `]` cannot
# cross `conflicts_with_all = ["manifest_path", "locked"]` either: the match
# died at the list's first `]` and the whole field went missing from the option
# map. Five real options were invisible that way — `sbom --binary`,
# `upgrade --accept`, `db scrub --check`, `db scrub --dry-run` and
# `generate admin --select` — every one of them a flag the guide tells readers
# to run. An option missing from the map is not a quiet inaccuracy in a table
# nobody reads: `resolve()` stops the walk at an option it does not recognise,
# so those five spellings silently switched the gate OFF for the rest of their
# line, and (once flags are gated) each would be reported as drift against a

# `<CAPSULE>`, and so do `autumn db --help` and `autumn deploy --help` against
# their required subcommands.
#
# Recognising these as ordinary booleans (which is what putting them in the
# option map did) made the walk consume one and then apply the end-of-input

# ------------------------------------------------------------ docs scanning

# Fences whose contents are shell input. `text` is included because a handful
# of pages fence terminal transcripts without a language; lines inside them
# still start with the command being demonstrated.
# EVERY fenced block is read, whatever language it is tagged with. A fence tag
# says what SYNTAX the block is, not whether the block contains commands a
# reader runs, and the corpus makes that distinction constantly: a GitHub
# Actions `run: |` step in a `yaml` fence (`data-scrubbing.md`), a nightly
# backup in a `cron` fence (`daemon.md`), a starter's post-scaffold notes
# inside a `toml` string (`starters.md`). Those are copyable recipes, and an
# allowlist of "shell-ish" tags skipped all of them.
#
# What discriminates is COMMAND POSITION, not the tag — `commands()` requires
# `autumn` to head a command, and that rejects the code and prose that sharing a
# fence with real commands would otherwise drag in. Measured on this corpus:
# reading every fence rather than an allowlist adds zero false positives, and a
# `rust` fence's `"…in-process autumn server"` string is skipped because
# `autumn` there is not in command position.
#
# The residual risk is a quoted string in a code fence that begins with
# `autumn ` and reads as a real command. Nothing in the corpus does, and a
# waiver deliberately cannot silence a fence (see WAIVERS), so the remedy would
# be to fix the page — which is the right outcome for a line that looks exactly
# like a command a reader could run.

# HOW A LINE IS TURNED INTO COMMANDS
#
# The line is TOKENIZED as shell, not split with regexes. Three review rounds
# of this gate were spent on the consequences of not doing that — operators and
# spaces inside a quoted value, a closing quote glued to the last token — and
# each ad-hoc fix left the next one waiting. `shlex` is in the standard library
# and settles the whole class: quotes bind, operators outside them separate
# commands, and `#` starts a comment (which is why a shell comment naming a
# command is no longer a special case in this file).
#
# Tokens, not text, are what the rest of the script reasons about, so a quoted
# option value is ONE token however many spaces or `&&`s are inside it.
# `;;` (and bash's `;&` / `;;&` fallthrough spellings) terminate a case ARM,
# so they separate commands exactly as `;` does — without them the arm's argv
# ran on into `;; esac`.
_OPERATORS = {'&&', '||', ';', '|', '&', '\n', ';;', ';&', ';;&'}

    """Every file a `Cargo.toml` publishes as its crate's README.

    PARSED AS TOML, not matched with a regex, and that is the point. Review
    found four ways a hand-rolled matcher misread a manifest: it took only
    double-quoted values, then only explicit keys, then ignored `publish`, then
    missed the inline-table spelling of the inheritance it did match. Each fix
    was correct and each left the next corner of the same grammar uncovered,
    because the thing being approximated is a TOML parser. `tomllib` is
    standard library and already used by `check-docs-toml.sh` and by
    `check-example-bin-names.sh`, the latter on `Cargo.toml` exactly like this.

    `cargo metadata` would be more authoritative still, and is deliberately not
    used: every docs gate shares a CI job that carries no Rust toolchain and no
    cache, on purpose, so that it reports in seconds and cannot be blocked by a
    compile failure elsewhere. Reading the manifests keeps that property.

    What Cargo does, and so does this: `readme = false` means none; a string is
    a path relative to the manifest; `workspace = true` takes the
    `[workspace.package]` value of the package's OWN workspace, relative to
    that workspace's root; and an ABSENT key discovers `README.md`,
    `README.txt` or `README` beside the manifest, in that order. A package that
    does not publish is skipped — it has no landing page to keep true, and
    enrolling its working notes made the drift gates fail on the illustrative
    commands such a page may contain.
