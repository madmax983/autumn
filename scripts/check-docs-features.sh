# Feature-gate drift gate: every reader-facing page that shows Rust reaching for
# an `autumn_web` item that only exists behind a NON-DEFAULT Cargo feature must
# name that feature on the page.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus already gates the seven things a reader copies off
# a page and the one thing they cannot copy at all.
# `scripts/check-docs-links.sh` gates its *links* (a 404 on GitHub),
# `scripts/check-docs-cli.sh` its *commands* (`unrecognized subcommand`),
# `scripts/check-docs-config.sh` the `AUTUMN_*` variables they SET (a silent
# no-op), `scripts/check-docs-toml.sh` the `autumn.toml` keys they WRITE
# (dropped silently), `scripts/check-docs-symbols.sh` the `autumn_web::…` paths
# they IMPORT (E0432 against their own file), `scripts/check-docs-routes.sh`
# the `/actuator/…` URLs they CURL, `scripts/check-docs-macro-args.sh` the
# keyword arguments they put inside an attribute macro,
# `scripts/check-docs-versions.sh` the dependency pin every one of those is
# relative to, and `scripts/check-docs-orphans.sh` asserts the page can be
# reached at all.
#
# Every one of them checks the page against a crate built with EVERY feature on.
# That is deliberate, and `check-docs-symbols.sh` says so in as many words:
#
#     Feature gates. The surface is read as a superset with every `#[cfg]`
#     ignored, so a path that only exists under `--features ws` still resolves.
#     Gating on the default feature set would report an item a reader can
#     absolutely use as missing; that direction of error is not worth trading
#     for […]
#
# That reasoning is right, and it leaves a hole exactly the shape of its own
# premise. The symbol gate proves `autumn_web::ws::WebSocket` EXISTS. It cannot
# ask the only question the reader has, which is whether it exists **in their
# build** — and `autumn-web`'s default feature set is eight features wide
# (`maud`, `htmx`, `tailwind`, `db`, `cache-moka`, `http-client`, `reporting`,
# `flash`) out of fifty. `ws`, `mail`, `pdf`, `storage`, `i18n`, `presence`,
# `markdown`, `mcp`, `seed`, `tls` and the rest are off unless the reader turns
# them on, and nothing in the corpus was required to tell them so.
#
# So a page could open on:
#
#     use autumn_web::pdf::Pdf;
#
#     #[get("/invoices/{id}/pdf")]
#     async fn invoice_pdf(id: Path<i64>) -> Pdf { … }
#
# — every path resolving, every macro argument valid, every link live — and the
# reader who pastes it into the project the quickstart just scaffolded gets
#
#     error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `pdf` in `autumn_web`
#
# with nothing anywhere naming the word `pdf` as a *feature*. This is the same
# failure class as the env gate's, one layer earlier: the compiler's message is
# about their file, the fix is a line in a file the page never showed them, and
# the page reads as correct to its author because the author's checkout has the
# feature on. `docs/guide/pdf-downloads.md` was in exactly that state at the
# baseline, and made the reason legible by pointing AT the missing line:
# "requires the `maud` feature; enabled together with `pdf` in the quick start
# above" — where the quick start above contains no `Cargo.toml` at all.
#
# THE BASELINE RUN found seventeen such page/feature pairs across thirteen
# pages, out of 149 gated uses in the corpus. Nine were visible from the first
# version of the extractor:
#
#   docs/guide/cloud-native.md:929        `#[ws]`                  -> ws
#   docs/guide/daemon.md:194              `autumn_web::managed_pg` -> managed-pg
#   docs/guide/macro-transparency.md:295  `#[ws]`                  -> ws
#   docs/guide/macro-transparency.md:1646 `#[mailer]`              -> mail
#   docs/guide/macro-transparency.md:1684 `#[inbound_mail]`        -> inbound-mail
#   docs/guide/mail-compliance.md:54      `#[mailer]`              -> mail
#   docs/guide/pdf-downloads.md:24        `autumn_web::pdf`        -> pdf
#   docs/guide/testing.md:739             `autumn_web::storage`    -> storage
#   docs/migrations/next.md:136           `autumn_web::tls`        -> tls
#
# and a tenth, reachable only once the gate resolved a second path segment:
#
#   docs/guide/jobs.md:824                `autumn_web::data::csv`  -> csv
#
# and four more once a bare name after a prelude glob was read:
#
#   docs/guide/custom-subsystems.md:202   `LocalChannelsBackend`   -> ws
#   docs/guide/events.md:69               `Mailer`                 -> mail
#   docs/guide/presence.md:48             `Presence`               -> presence
#   docs/guide/transactions.md:322        `Mailer`                 -> mail
#
# and a fifteenth once `t!` was read:
#
#   docs/guide/macro-transparency.md:1727 `t!`                     -> i18n
#
# and two more once a gated ITEM under an ungated module was read:
#
#   docs/guide/generators.md:871          `sse::stream`            -> ws
#   docs/migrations/next.md:259           `openapi::Parameter`     -> openapi
#
# `presence.md` is the one to read twice. It was not missing the feature name —
# it gave the WRONG one, pinning `features = ["ws"]` and saying the extractor
# "is available from `autumn_web::prelude::*` automatically when `ws` is
# enabled". `presence = ["ws"]` runs one way only, so a reader who followed that
# line exactly got an app with no `Presence` in it, from the page whose whole
# subject is `Presence`.
#
# Three of them sit under a literal "**You write:**" heading. None is a page
# about an obscure corner: `cloud-native.md` is the deployment guide, and its
# `#[ws]` block is the WebSocket *drain contract* — read by someone wiring up a
# rolling deploy, which is the worst moment to discover a missing feature.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (single fast job, no Rust toolchain needed):
#   1. Inside a ```rust fence, a path `autumn_web::<item>` whose first segment
#      is a top-level item of `autumn-web` carrying a `#[cfg(feature = "…")]`
#      for a feature OUTSIDE the default closure.
#   2. Inside a ```rust fence, an attribute `#[<macro>]` or a bang macro
#      `<name>!` gated under such a `#[cfg]`. WHICH of the two a name is comes
#      from `autumn-macros/src/lib.rs`, where every export carries
#      `#[proc_macro]` or `#[proc_macro_attribute]` one line above it — 12 bang
#      and 35 attribute. This list was once written by hand as "`#[ws]`,
#      `#[mailer]`, `#[mailer_preview]`, `#[mail_previews]`, `#[inbound_mail]`,
#      `#[wire_client]`", and two of those six are not attributes at all:
#      `mail_previews![…]` and `wire_client!` are bang macros. An attribute is
#      the form the prelude is USED in, so leaving either kind out would exempt
#      the most-copied constructs in the guide.
#   3. The page then has to NAME that feature, in a spelling a reader can act
#      on: a `features = [ … "ws" … ]` array TIED TO autumn-web — either the
#      inline table `autumn-web = { …, features = [ … ] }` or a
#      `[dependencies.autumn-web]` section, with newlines and comments inside
#      the array fine, since the corpus writes them that way — a `--features
#      ws` invocation, the prose forms `` `ws` feature ``/`` `ws` Cargo
#      feature ``/`` feature `ws` ``/`` feature flag `i18n` ``, or a
#      `[features]` table row `ws = [`. Every spelling is live in the corpus.
#
#      The TIE matters and was missing at first. An unqualified `features = […]`
#      match let ANY dependency's array satisfy the gate, and
#      `skills/autumn-web/references/api-reference.md:1303` carries
#      `axum = { version = "0.8", features = ["macros", "ws"] }` — which enables
#      axum's websocket support and does nothing for autumn-web's `ws`. `ws`,
#      `mail`, `tls`, `redis`, `openapi`, `markdown` and `csv` are all ordinary
#      feature names in other crates, so that was a standing false-negative
#      channel rather than one page's bad luck. Found by Codex review on #2800;
#      no page in the corpus was relying on it, so the tie cost nothing to add.
#
# NAMING, NOT PLACEMENT. The rule is that the feature is named SOMEWHERE on the
# page, not that it is named before the first fence that needs it. Placement is
# the sharper reader question — three pages name the feature only AFTER the code
# that needs it, worst of them `docs/guide/tauri-mobile-offline-sync.md`, where
# the `offline-sync` line sits 221 lines below the first fence that needs it —
# and it is deliberately NOT gated. A page whose enabling line lives in a
# "Prerequisites" section further down is a legitimate shape, and a gate that
# ordered a restructure of it would trade a reader defect for an author fight.
# Presence is the half that is unarguable: without it there is no line to find
# at all, at any distance. The ordering count is printed on every run and
# itemised by `--list`, so the next pass has it measured rather than felt.
#
# TRUTH SET: parsed from `autumn/src/lib.rs`, `autumn/src/prelude.rs` and
# `autumn/Cargo.toml`, not from a checked-in snapshot — for the reason
# `check-docs-cli.sh` gives: a snapshot is one forgotten regeneration away from
# gating the docs against a crate that no longer exists, which is the very
# failure this script is for. Move an item behind a new feature and the gate
# moves with it in the same commit.
#
#   - The default closure is computed TRANSITIVELY from `[features]`, because
#     `default` names eight features and those name more (`db` implies
#     `autumn-macros/db`, `oauth2` implies `http-client`). Taking the literal
#     `default = [...]` list instead would report `reporting`'s items — pulled
#     in by nothing else — as needing to be enabled, on every page that shows a
#     failure capsule.
#   - Only COLUMN-ZERO declarations count. `lib.rs` carries five inline
#     `pub mod … {` blocks (`include_dir`, `__fuzz`, `__private`, `reexports`,
#     `tests`), and 21 of its `#[cfg(feature = …)] pub use` lines are indented
#     inside them. Those items are not `autumn_web::<item>` — they are
#     `autumn_web::__fuzz::<item>` — and reading them as top-level would put
#     `extract_path_params` (openapi) and four `plugin-sandbox` fuzz seams in
#     the truth set under names nothing documents. The workspace runs
#     `cargo fmt --all`, so top-level is column zero.
#   - A CONJUNCTION requires all of its conjuncts, and every non-default one is
#     reported. Eleven column-zero attributes here are `#[cfg(all(…))]`:
#     `presence_badge` is `all(presence, maud)` and `presence_stream` is a
#     line-wrapped `all(presence, ws, maud, htmx)`. The first version of this
#     gate read only the single-feature form — and said so in this paragraph,
#     claiming "autumn-web has no such form on a top-level item today", which
#     was simply false. Both items were missing from the truth set entirely, so
#     a fence naming either would have passed while the reader's build failed
#     for want of `presence` or `ws`. Found by Codex review on #2800; the
#     attribute is now read by PARENTHESIS BALANCE, since `presence_stream`'s
#     wraps across four lines and a line-anchored regex cannot see it.
#     Requirements that are default (`maud`, `htmx`) are dropped rather than
#     demanded, so an item behind default features alone — `live`, behind
#     `all(htmx, maud)` — is not gated surface at all.
#   - A `#[cfg(not(…))]` predicate is a build CONSTRAINT, not a requirement, so
#     it contributes no feature name — reading one out would tell a reader to
#     enable the very feature that removes the item (`lib.rs` has
#     `#[cfg(not(feature = "seed"))]`). It does NOT cancel the positive
#     conjuncts beside it, though: `capsule::build_recording_pool` is
#     `all(feature = "test-support", feature = "db", not(feature = "sqlite"))`
#     and still needs `test-support` in an ordinary default build. Dropping the
#     whole gate on sight of a `not(` hid that. Found by Codex review on #2800.
#   - A declaration made at least once with NO feature requirement removes its
#     gated siblings in the same namespace. `autumn/src/db.rs` defines
#     `RuntimeConnection` under both `not(feature = "sqlite")` and
#     `feature = "sqlite"`; recording only the positive arm put
#     `db::RuntimeConnection` in the surface as needing `sqlite`, which would
#     have told a reader on the ordinary Postgres path to enable the one
#     feature that swaps their database backend. PER NAMESPACE, because
#     stripping by name alone then removed `autumn_web::edge` — the gated crate
#     re-export — on account of `#[edge]`, the ungated attribute macro sharing
#     its name. Both found by Codex review on #2800, the second while fixing
#     the first.
#   - `#[cfg(any(…))]` is dropped too — naming ONE alternative satisfies it and
#     this gate cannot tell which a page meant — with ONE resolved exception:
#     `any(test, feature = "X")`, where every non-feature predicate is one that
#     cannot hold in a reader's build. `cfg(test)` is set for the crate being
#     compiled as a test and NEVER for its dependencies, so a reader writing a
#     test against autumn-web does not get that branch and genuinely needs `X`.
#     `autumn/src/metrics.rs:1991` gates `metrics::testing` exactly so, and
#     `docs/guide/metrics.md:465` hands the reader
#     `autumn_web::metrics::testing::unique_name`. Dropping the whole item hid
#     a real requirement rather than avoiding a guess. Found by Codex review on
#     #2800. A genuine `any(feature = "a", feature = "b")` is still dropped.
#   - NAMING AN IMPLYING FEATURE COUNTS, because Cargo activates what a feature
#     implies. `presence = ["ws"]`, so a page that writes
#     `features = ["presence"]` beside a `presence_stream` snippet is correct
#     and complete — the reader's build gets `ws` too. Subtracting only the
#     default closure and then demanding each conjunct BY NAME reported `ws` as
#     missing on exactly that correct page: the gate telling an author to break
#     something that works, which is the one error direction this whole family
#     refuses to trade for. The check now asks whether anything the page names
#     ACTIVATES the requirement, walking the manifest's implication graph. The
#     same edge runs through `mcp = ["openapi"]`, `constela = ["maud"]`,
#     `offline-sync = ["db", "http-client"]` and `oauth2 = ["http-client"]`, so
#     it is a rule about the manifest, not a special case. Found by Codex
#     review on #2800.
#   - A WHOLE CRATE re-exported under a new name is a module to the reader.
#     `#[cfg(feature = "edge")] pub use autumn_edge as edge;` is how
#     `autumn_web::edge::…` exists at all, and it carries no `::` for either
#     `pub use` pattern to bite on, so `edge` was missing from the truth set
#     and a fence writing `autumn_web::edge::EdgeRoute` would have passed
#     ungated. Found by Codex review on #2800. No page uses it in a rust fence
#     today, so this closed a hole rather than fixing a page.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK:
#   - A bare identifier in a fence with NO prelude glob. One WITH a glob is
#     read, and this bullet used to refuse that outright, arguing from a
#     prelude surface "174 items wide with names like `Format`, `Column`,
#     `Link`, `Client`, `Patch`, `Lock`, `Story` and `Transport`" that
#     "matching those as words would report most of the guide". That was the
#     wrong number: every ambiguous name in it is behind `maud` or `db`, both
#     DEFAULT, so none is gated surface at all. The set actually at risk is 31
#     uppercase names, and measuring the corpus found 27 occurrences over 14
#     page/name pairs — of which FOUR were live defects, including
#     `docs/guide/presence.md`, which told readers to enable `ws` when the
#     feature is `presence` (`presence = ["ws"]` runs one way only, so that
#     app has no `Presence` at all). Found by Codex review on #2800. Two rules
#     keep it safe: the fence must write the glob, and the name must start
#     UPPERCASE — which excludes `t`, every module and every macro by
#     construction. `check-docs-symbols.sh` still stops at bare identifiers,
#     because it is resolving PATHS; this is asking a narrower question.
#   - A name inside a `use autumn_web::{…}`
#     GROUP is not a bare identifier and IS read — the group names the path, so
#     nothing has to be inferred — including a nested `{pdf::Pdf}`. Single-line
#     groups only: the corpus writes no multi-line one, and this reads a line at
#     a time. Found by Codex review on #2800, over 16 grouped imports in the
#     corpus's rust fences.
#   - (Nothing about bang macros. This bullet twice claimed `t!` could not be
#     read — "`\bt!\(` is one character long: `assert!(`, `insert!(`,
#     `expect!(` and `vec!(` all end in it" — and that is simply false. A word
#     boundary requires a NON-word character before the `t`, and in `assert!`
#     the `t` follows `r`. `\bt!` matches none of them, which one `re` call
#     would have shown either time. The claim survived two rounds because it
#     was reasoned about rather than run. `t!` is read now, with no length
#     floor: the boundary plus membership in the parsed bang set is the whole
#     filter. It had a live defect behind it —
#     `docs/guide/macro-transparency.md:1727` offers `t!(locale, …)` under a
#     "**You write:**" heading on a page that names `i18n` nowhere. Found by
#     Codex review on #2800.)
#   - Anything past the SECOND path segment. One level down IS resolved, for
#     both MODULES and ITEMS, and has to be: a gate below an unconditional
#     module is invisible from the head, and worst when the head is a DEFAULT
#     feature or no feature at all. `autumn_web::db::sqlite_types` needs
#     `sqlite` while `db` is on by default; `autumn_web::openapi::Parameter`
#     needs `openapi` while `pub mod openapi;` carries no `#[cfg]` at all, so
#     the path resolved to nothing and the gate vouched for it
#     (`docs/migrations/next.md:259`, a live defect; `sse::stream` under `ws`
#     was a second). Both found by Codex review on #2800; surface 71 -> 197,
#     checked uses 137 -> 149. For modules only `pub mod` counts — 11 of the 40
#     gated child modules are a private `mod tests`, which is not a path any
#     reader can write. A THIRD segment is an item inside a module inside a
#     module; resolving it needs type resolution, which is where
#     `check-docs-symbols.sh` stops and where this stops too.
#   - Non-`rust` fences and prose. A feature gate is a COMPILE failure, so the
#     only place it can bite is a block a reader compiles. `autumn_web::pdf::Pdf`
#     in a README's capability table is a description of the example, not a
#     line anyone pastes, and gating those made the root `README.md` and
#     `EXAMPLES.md` catalogs report against every feature they mention.
#   - Crates other than `autumn-web`. `autumn-cli`, `autumn-macros` and the
#     plugin crates carry their own features; none of them is reached through
#     an `autumn_web::` path, and the macros a reader writes are re-exported
#     THROUGH `autumn-web`, which is where this reads their gate from.
#
# THE CORPUS IS THE SIBLINGS'. The `INCLUDE_DIRS`/`INCLUDE_FILES`/
# `package_readmes` block below is copied verbatim from
# `check-docs-versions.sh`, and this gate is registered in
# `scripts/check-docs-scope.sh`'s `SIBLINGS` in the same commit. #2709 exists
# because four gates each spelled their own corpus and three of them drifted; a
# sixth gate spelling a sixth copy, unwatched, is how that recurs.
#
# WAIVERS. A page that must SHOW a gated construct rather than offer it — a
# comparison table, a migration note quoting an old snippet — waives it beside
# the passage, with a reason:
#
#     <!-- feature-gate-allow: ws — quoted from the 0.5 release notes, not a
#          snippet this page offers -->
#
# A waiver covers its own blank-line-separated block and the one above it, the
# same scope `check-docs-routes.sh` and `check-docs-versions.sh` give theirs: a
# page-wide waiver silently re-admits the defect the gate exists to catch. The
# baseline needed none — all eight defects were real, including the three under
# "**You write:**" — so the mechanism ships unexercised by the corpus and
# exercised by `--self-test`.

    found four ways a hand-rolled matcher misread a manifest: it took only
    double-quoted values, then only explicit keys, then ignored `publish`, then
    missed the inline-table spelling of the inheritance it did match. Each fix
    was correct and each left the next corner of the same grammar uncovered,
    because the thing being approximated is a TOML parser. `tomllib` is
    standard library and already used by `check-docs-toml.sh` and by
    `check-example-bin-names.sh`, the latter on `Cargo.toml` exactly like this.

    `cargo metadata` would be more authoritative still, and is deliberately not
    used: every docs gate shares a CI job that carries no Rust toolchain and no
    cache, on purpose, so that it reports in seconds and cannot be blocked by a
    compile failure elsewhere. Reading the manifests keeps that property.

    What Cargo does, and so does this: `readme = false` means none; a string is
    a path relative to the manifest; `workspace = true` takes the
    `[workspace.package]` value of the package's OWN workspace, relative to
    that workspace's root; and an ABSENT key discovers `README.md`,
    `README.txt` or `README` beside the manifest, in that order. A package that
    does not publish is skipped — it has no landing page to keep true, and
    enrolling its working notes made the drift gates fail on the illustrative

        which one a page meant). Both under-report rather than over-report: a
        page is never failed for a feature the gate guessed at.

    The attribute may wrap across lines — `presence_stream`'s does — so the

    The rule is general rather than a `not(`-specific patch: a declaration made
    at least once with no feature requirement — a complementary `cfg` arm, a
    bare declaration beside a gated re-export — is available in a default build.

    A feature gate below an UNCONDITIONAL module is invisible from the first
    path segment, and the worst case is the one where the parent is a DEFAULT
    feature: `autumn_web::db::sqlite_types` needs `sqlite`, `db` is on by
    default, so reading only the head drops the whole path out of the surface
    and the gate vouches for a line that does not build. `storage::variant`
    (`variants`) is the same shape with a non-default parent. Found by Codex
    review on #2800.

    Only `pub mod` counts: a private `mod tests` gated by a feature is not a
    path any reader can write, and 11 of the 40 gated child modules are that.
    Requirements are the UNION of the parent's and the child's, because a
    reader needs both — `storage::variant` wants `storage` and `variants`,
    though the manifest's `variants = ["storage", …]` means naming the second
    already brings the first (see `enablers()`).

    TWO levels below the crate root, not one and not arbitrary depth. One level
    was the original boundary, argued from `check-docs-symbols.sh` stopping at
    the first item segment because resolving further needs type resolution. A
    module path is the part that does not, and the argument stopped a level too
    early: `autumn_web::capsule::capture::with_capture_scope` is a public
    function gated by `any(test, feature = "test-support")` under an
    unconditional `pub mod capture;`, reachable by reading one more FILE rather
    than by resolving any type. The corpus writes **36** three-segment paths in
    reader-facing rust fences — `auth::impersonation::*`,
    `cache::coherence::*`, `capsule::regression::*` among them — so this was
    not a hypothetical rung. Found by Codex review on #2800.

    The limit is where a path stops being module segments: `a::b::c` is the
    deepest a reader writes in this corpus, and a FOURTH segment would be an
    item inside `c`, which is the type-resolution problem the symbol gate
    declines. `MAX_MODULE_DEPTH` names it so the boundary is one number rather
    than a shape buried in a loop.

A page that hands someone Rust reaching for a feature-gated item, and never
names the feature, fails them at `cargo build` with a message about THEIR file:

    error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `pdf` in `autumn_web`

The item exists, every path on the page resolves, and the missing line is in a
file the page never showed them. Fix it where it lives — add the enabling line
to the page, ideally above the first block that needs it:

    ```toml
    autumn-web = { version = "0.7", features = ["pdf"] }
    ```

Any of these spellings satisfies the gate, so a page that already explains the
feature in prose needs no fence:

    the `pdf` feature          the `pdf` Cargo feature
    feature `pdf`              feature flag `pdf`
    cargo build --features pdf

A construct the page must SHOW rather than offer — a quoted release note, a
comparison against an older API — is waived beside the passage, with a reason:

    <!-- feature-gate-allow: ws — quoted from the 0.5 release notes, not a
         snippet this page offers -->

Inspect what the gate read:  scripts/check-docs-features.sh --list
The truth set it read it against:  scripts/check-docs-features.sh --surface
