#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Guide-index completeness gate: every page in `docs/guide/` must be listed in
# `docs/guide/index.md`, and that index must be linked from `README.md`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus gates every page a reader ALREADY REACHED — its
# links (`check-docs-links.sh`), its commands (`check-docs-cli.sh`), its
# `AUTUMN_*` variables (`check-docs-config.sh`), its `autumn.toml` keys
# (`check-docs-toml.sh`), its `autumn_web::…` paths (`check-docs-symbols.sh`),
# its `/actuator/…` URLs (`check-docs-routes.sh`), its macro arguments, its
# feature gates and its version pins. `check-docs-orphans.sh` goes one step
# further and proves the page can be reached AT ALL.
#
# Reachable is not findable, and the gap between them is where this corpus was
# losing readers. `check-docs-orphans.sh` asks "does any inbound link exist",
# and it passes when the only inbound link is a mid-page crosslink from another
# guide page or a mention inside an agent `SKILL.md` — a surface written for a
# language model, not for a person with a question. Its own header says where
# discovery actually happens:
#
#   "docs/guide/ has no index page of its own. The guide pages are discovered
#    through the hand-maintained `## Documentation` list in README.md and the
#    skill indexes — surfaces someone has to remember to update. Nothing
#    noticed when they forgot."
#
# Nothing noticed, and they forgot 92 times. The baseline run of this gate, on
# the commit that introduced it, found 92 of the 147 `docs/guide/` pages listed
# in NO reader-facing index — 63% of the guide. Among them were the pages a
# reader needs in their first week:
#
#   docs/guide/middleware.md      docs/guide/testing.md
#   docs/guide/migrations.md      docs/guide/repositories.md
#   docs/guide/jobs.md            docs/guide/authorization.md
#   docs/guide/pagination.md      docs/guide/websockets.md
#   docs/guide/rate-limiting.md   docs/guide/i18n.md
#   docs/guide/events.md          docs/guide/oauth.md
#
# A cold retrieval test over the README's `## Documentation` list — the repo's
# landing page, and the one surface an arriving reader is guaranteed to see —
# found the answering page absent for 11 of 15 ordinary question classes. The
# answers all existed and every drift gate was green over them. The reader
# simply had no way to land on them, which is indistinguishable, from where
# they sit, from the feature not existing.
#
# WHY AN INDEX RATHER THAN 92 MORE README BULLETS. `README.md` is the project's
# landing page, not its table of contents; its `## Documentation` list is a
# curated set of highlights with paragraph-length entries, and pasting the
# whole guide into it would bury the highlights without making the rest
# navigable. The index is a separate page whose entire job is navigation, which
# is also why it carries no answers of its own: an index that explains things
# is a page that drifts against the pages it indexes.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (single fast job, no Rust toolchain needed):
#   1. Every tracked page under `docs/guide/` is listed in the index that owns
#      it — exactly once, counted ACROSS ALL INDEXES. Twice is a defect: a
#      reader who meets the same page under two headings cannot tell whether
#      they are the same page, and the second entry is the one that rots. A
#      per-file tally cannot see the worst version of this — the top-level
#      index listing a tutorial chapter that `tutorial/index.md` also lists
#      shows one hit in each file — so entries are gathered from every index
#      before any of them is judged.
#   2. Every guide page an index links exists, and is a guide page. A link to
#      a page that moved is caught by `check-docs-links.sh` as a 404; this
#      catches an index pointing somewhere outside the corpus it indexes.
#   3. Every entry sits under a `## ` section heading, so a page appended to
#      the end of the file lands somewhere a reader is actually scanning.
#   4. `README.md` carries a markdown LINK whose target resolves to
#      `docs/guide/index.md`. An index nobody can reach from the landing page
#      is the very defect this gate exists to prevent, and it would otherwise
#      be the one page the gate could not see. Checking for the literal path as
#      a substring is not enough: a plain-text mention satisfies it while
#      getting the reader nowhere, so the README's link destinations are
#      parsed and resolved.
#
# AN ENTRY HAS A SHAPE, and stating it is what retired this gate's markdown
# parser. An entry is a COLUMN-ZERO list item whose content begins with a link:
#
#   - [Forms, Validation and Normalization](forms.md) — re-rendering a …
#   1. [Project Setup](01-project-setup.md) — scaffold a project, run …
#
# The first several revisions asked the opposite question — "is this link in a
# context where a reader could click it?" — and answered it by subtracting
# contexts one at a time. Review found nine of them: fenced code, HTML
# comments, inline code, four-space indented blocks, blocks indented relative
# to an enclosing list item, tab indentation, images, escaped brackets, raw
# HTML. Each finding was correct, the list had no end (the real task was
# "implement CommonMark"), and two of the patches introduced fresh bugs in the
# opposite direction — once blanking nested lists that were real rows, once
# refusing to see code nested inside a list.
#
# Matching the shape instead rejects all of those without a rule for any of
# them, and it fails SAFE: because this gate separately requires every page to
# have an entry, a row written in one of those ways is reported as a page
# listed nowhere. The index is told it is malformed, loudly, rather than
# half-checked quietly.
#
# `readable()` now handles only what is left — the multi-line regions that can
# still put a row-shaped line at column zero: fenced code, HTML comments and
# raw HTML blocks.
#
# The shape also separates an index's rows from its PROSE, which matters in the
# other direction. `tutorial/index.md` carries four ordinary cross-references
# in paragraphs and blockquotes — "see the [i18n guide]", "if you have already
# read the [Getting Started guide]" — which claim to index nothing. Counting
# them made the gate report 165 links for 161 required pages, and under the
# cross-index rule above it would have flagged every one as a duplicate listing
# of a page another index owns. Writing about a page is not indexing it.
#
# The cost is that a row must be top level. An index that nests rows under
# sub-bullets is told so by name; that is a constraint on 161 lines this gate
# also owns, and a cheap one for retiring an open-ended parser.
#
# DELEGATION TO A SUB-INDEX. A subdirectory of `docs/guide/` that carries its
# own `index.md` — `tutorial/` does — is represented in the TOP-LEVEL index by
# that `index.md` alone, and owns its own pages. The tutorial is 12 ordered
# chapters; listing them individually in a task-shaped index would spray twelve
# near-identical entries across it and tell a reader nothing about which one to
# open first. The sub-index is listed, and it owns its own ordering.
#
# Delegation is not an escape. Each page is checked against the NEAREST index
# above it, so an unlisted tutorial chapter fails against `tutorial/index.md`
# rather than vanishing from the required set — and the rule nests to any
# depth. Getting that wrong is how the first revision of this gate let a new
# tutorial chapter listed nowhere at all pass with zero defects.
#
# TRUTH SET: `git ls-files docs/guide`, read at run time. There is no snapshot
# to regenerate — a page added in a commit is required by this gate in the same
# commit, which is the only moment anyone has the context to write its line.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-docs-guide-index.sh              # gate the real corpus

# A markdown link whose target is a guide page, written relative to the index

# relative depth — that is its sibling's job, not this one's.
#
# `(?<![!\\])` rejects two things that share every other character with a link
# and navigate nowhere: an image (`![alt](page.md)` renders a picture) and an
# escaped bracket (`\[Guide](page.md)` renders literal text).
# A link destination may contain BALANCED parentheses — `other(foo).md` is an
# ordinary path — so it is not "everything up to the first `)`". Reading it
# that way ended the span early and left the rest of the link, title included,
# for the reference scan to misread as navigation.
#
# `_FRAG` is deliberately gated behind a literal `#`. Its only job is to eat a
# fragment, and writing it as a second open-ended run would let it and `_DEST`
# match the same characters — an ambiguity the engine explores by backtracking,
# which is a quiet way to turn a 1000-line corpus into a hang.

# fragment of a path that resolves to nothing, so a real row written that way
# was reported as listed nowhere. The angled form is therefore its own

# An index ENTRY, and the reason this gate no longer tries to parse markdown.

# An entry is a list item AT COLUMN ZERO whose content begins immediately with
# a link: `- [Title](page.md) — what it answers`, or `1. [Chapter](01-x.md)` in
# an ordered sub-index. Nothing else is an entry.
#
# Recognising entries by "a link, minus every context where a link is not
# clickable" was the source of nine of this PR's review findings. Each was
# correct and each was a different markdown construct — fenced code, HTML
# comments, inline code, four-space indented blocks, blocks indented relative
# to an enclosing list item, tab indentation, images, escaped brackets — and
# the list does not end, because the real task was "implement CommonMark",
# which no amount of regex reaches. Two of the patches introduced fresh bugs in
# the opposite direction.
#
# Stating the shape instead inverts the problem. Every one of those constructs
# fails to match this pattern, so none of them is an entry, and none of them
# needs its own rule. It also fails in the SAFE direction: this gate separately
# requires every page to have an entry, so a row written in any of those ways
# is reported as a page listed nowhere. The index is malformed loudly rather
# than accepted quietly, and the message says what the shape is.
#
# The cost is that an entry must be a top-level row. An index that nests rows
# under sub-bullets is told so by name rather than silently half-checked; that
# is a constraint on 161 lines this gate also owns, and a cheap one for
# retiring an open-ended parser.
# Brackets nest to ANY depth, so link text is scanned rather than matched.
#
# A regex can express one level (`[A [x]]`), and a bounded expansion can
# express a fixed few, but `- [A [one [two]]](alpha.md)` is an ordinary row
# and every fixed bound is a false failure one level further down. The rest
# of this file's grammar stays in regex; only the counting part moved out,
# because counting is the part a regex cannot do.
# The pieces of a link's tail that regex still handles: the opening paren
# with its whitespace, the angle-bracketed destination form, and the close

# The ANGLE form is tried FIRST, because it is the one destination that may

    only one. So a definition-SHAPED line that defines nothing was blanked
    anyway by `blank_defns` — and a real, clickable link inside what is
    actually ordinary paragraph text went with it.

    Every rule a definition must satisfy lives here, so there is no fourth
    place to forget one:

    - it must START A BLOCK, or it is a line of the paragraph above it
    - its label must be a label — foldable, and within the 999-character cap
    - its destination must parse, angled by that grammar and bare by
      `dest_at`'s balancing

    KNOWN RENDERER SPLIT, on that last rule. The premise behind it — that
    `[x]: dest#(unterminated` "creates no definition" — is true of
    markdown-it-py and of the spec's "parentheses only if balanced" wording,
    but NOT of cmark 0.31 or cmark-gfm, which is what GitHub serves this
    README with. Both of those define the label and resolve the reference:

        [x]: bad(unbalanced        ->  <p><a href="bad(unbalanced">Guide</a></p>

        [Guide][x]

    So this rule costs a false failure against GitHub on that one spelling.
    It is kept anyway, deliberately: `check-docs-orphans.sh` applies the same
    rule to the same construct, and the repo pins it in
    `migration_guide_gate_rejects_an_unbalanced_paren_in_a_definition`. Three
    gates disagreeing about what a definition IS would be a worse defect than
    all three being stricter than GitHub on a spelling no corpus page uses.
    Changing it is a cross-gate decision, raised on the PR rather than taken
    here. INLINE destinations are not affected — there the implementations
    agree, because `)` has to close something.

                             the internal feature name
  - page listed twice     -> keep the entry under the section a reader would
                             look in first, and delete the other
  - link to nothing       -> the page moved or was deleted; point at the
                             current path, or drop the entry
  - entry above every `## ` heading -> move it under the section it belongs to
  - README link missing   -> restore the `docs/guide/index.md` link in
