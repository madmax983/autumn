#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Markdown link gate: every relative link and heading anchor in the tracked
# markdown corpus must resolve.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: `scripts/check-docs.sh` gates *rustdoc* intra-doc links
# (`cargo doc -D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`), and
# `scripts/check-plugin-freshness.sh` gates the `docs/guide/*.md` paths named
# from `skills/` and `agents/`. Between them, nothing checked the ~385-file
# markdown corpus itself, so a guide could link to a page that was renamed,
# never written, or lives one directory up and nothing would notice. The
# baseline run of this script found 19 such links across 11 pages — including
# five in `docs/guide/aggregates.md` that were rustdoc paths
# (`[x](autumn_web::aggregate::GroupedAggregate)`) pasted into hand-written
# markdown, where they render as relative links to a directory that does not
# exist. A reader clicking one gets a 404, and unlike a wrong sentence a 404
# is a defect they cannot route around.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (single fast job, no Rust toolchain needed):
#   1. Relative file links resolve to a path that exists on disk.
#   2. Heading anchors resolve — both in-page (`#section`) and cross-page
#      (`other.md#section`) — against GitHub's slug algorithm.
#   3. Rustdoc-style paths (`crate::mod::Item`) used as a markdown link
#      target are reported under their own message, because the fix is to
#      link to docs.rs rather than to repair a path.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK:
#   - External `http(s)://` links. Network-dependent, so they would make this
#     gate flaky and slow; a link that 404s on someone else's server is also
#     not something a PR author can fix in this repo.
#   - Link targets inside fenced or inline code. Those are samples, not links.
#   - `examples/*/content/`. That tree is seed content for the wiki example
#     app, rendered by that app's own `#[static_get("/docs/{slug}")]` route —
#     its `/docs/configuration` is a live app route, not a file path.
#
# ANCHOR SLUGS: GitHub lowercases the heading, strips everything that is not
# a word character, whitespace, or a hyphen, then maps each remaining space
# to its own hyphen. It does NOT collapse runs, so `## a — b` becomes `a--b`
# (the em dash vanishes and both of its spaces survive). Getting this wrong
# in either direction produces confident nonsense, so it is exercised by
# --self-test.
#
# USAGE:
#   scripts/check-docs-links.sh              # gate the corpus
#   scripts/check-docs-links.sh --self-test  # synthetic-corpus tests

    Scanned line by line rather than matched with an anchored regex, because
    a fence may be indented up to three columns past the start of its
    containing block: nested in a list item it routinely sits at four or more
    columns, which no fixed `^ {0,3}` prefix can express. This corpus uses 2-
    and 3-space fences in 176 places today; treating a markdown sample inside
    one as a live link would fail this gate on text that renders as code.

    The bound matters as much as the allowance. At top level, a line indented
    four or more columns is an *indented code block*, not a fence — so
    accepting unlimited indentation would let a pair of such lines swallow the
    live paragraph between them, hiding any broken link in it. So the innermost
    open list item's content column is tracked, and a fence is recognised only
    within three columns of it.

    A fence closes on the same character at least as long as the opener, so
    a ```` ``` ```` sample nested inside a ```` ```` ```` block stays inside it.

    An unclosed fence runs to end of file, which is what CommonMark specifies
    and what GitHub renders — so a file with an unbalanced fence has its tail
    treated as code by this gate exactly as a reader sees it. That is correct
    but worth knowing: it means such a tail is not link-checked. One file is
    in that state today (`skills/autumn-web/SKILL.md`, whose ```` ```bash ````
    opener around line 2479 went missing); balancing it is a separate change,
    not this gate's business.

    Fence lines are blanked rather than dropped so line positions survive:
    Setext heading detection below needs to know what really preceded an
    underline, and deleting a fenced block would splice a paragraph onto a
    following `---` and invent a heading that is not there.

FAIL: the markdown corpus has unresolvable links (listed above).

Fix each one where it lives:
  - renamed or moved page  -> point at the current path
  - page that never existed -> drop the cross-reference, or write the page
  - wrong relative depth    -> `../x.md` vs `./x.md`
  - rustdoc path            -> link to https://docs.rs/autumn-web/latest/...
  - anchor                  -> match the heading's GitHub slug (each space
                               becomes its own hyphen; `—` is stripped, so
                               `## a — b` is `#a--b`)
