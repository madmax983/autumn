# Macro-argument drift gate: every keyword argument the reader-facing docs put
# inside an Autumn attribute macro must name a key that macro parses.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus already gates six of the seven things a reader
# copies off a page.
# `scripts/check-docs-links.sh` gates its *links* (a 404 on GitHub),
# `scripts/check-docs-cli.sh` its *commands* (`unrecognized subcommand`),
# `scripts/check-docs-config.sh` the `AUTUMN_*` variables they SET (a silent
# no-op), `scripts/check-docs-toml.sh` the `autumn.toml` keys they WRITE
# (dropped silently), `scripts/check-docs-symbols.sh` the `autumn_web::…` paths
# they IMPORT (E0432 against their own file), and
# `scripts/check-docs-routes.sh` the `/actuator/…` URLs they REQUEST (a 404
# that reads like a feature they failed to enable). `check-docs-orphans.sh`
# asserts the page can be reached at all.
#
# Nothing gated the surface the guide spends most of its Rust on: the
# *arguments* to the attribute macros. `#[secured]`, `#[job]`, `#[scheduled]`,
# `#[cached]`, `#[throttle]`, `#[model]`, `#[repository]` and their siblings
# each carry a bespoke keyword grammar, and a page can name a key that macro
# has never parsed. The reader pastes the annotation onto their own handler and
# the build stops on their file, with a message about a grammar they were
# copying in good faith from the page that taught it to them.
#
# The baseline run found five occurrences of one spelling:
# `#[secured(policy = "…")]`, across `docs/guide/downloads.md` (twice),
# `skills/autumn-web/references/examples.md`, and — the sharp half — the
# rustdoc module headers of `autumn/src/download.rs` and `autumn/src/range.rs`,
# which ship to docs.rs as the landing pages for `Download` and ranged
# responses. `#[secured]` has never had a `policy` key: its grammar is bare
# role literals and/or `scopes = ["…"]`, and a `policy` key lands on the
# catch-all arm of `parse_secured_args` and fails the build. The corpus already
# spelled the working form twice (`#[secured(scopes = ["reports:read"])]`, in
# `docs/guide/openapi.md` and `docs/guide/authentication.md`), so the page that
# would have rescued the reader existed — under a different key AND a different
# separator (`reports.read` vs `reports:read`), which is exactly the pair a
# reader cannot guess their way across.
#
# Why it survived every existing gate: both rustdoc fences are ```ignore, so
# rustdoc never compiles them, and the markdown fences are not compiled by
# anything at all. The spelling looked plausible enough to be copied forward
# from one file into four.
#
# ── Truth set ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The accepted keys are read out of each macro's own source in
# `autumn-macros/src/`, never from a snapshot: a renamed key lands in the same
# commit as the rename, so this gate cannot go stale behind the crate it
# checks. A macro's argument grammar is expressed in exactly one of a handful
# of shapes, and the extractor reads all of them:
#
#   meta.path.is_ident("ttl")            `#[cached(ttl = …)]`
#   key != "grant"                       `#[agent_operable(grant = …)]`
#   key.as_deref() != Some("max_age")    `#[step_up(max_age = …)]`
#   match key.as_str() { "resource" =>   `#[authorize(resource = …)]`
#
# The last two are read only where the thing being tested is a *key*. A
# comparison needs a positively key-ish left side rather than merely a
# not-value-ish one: `window != "pending"` in `job.rs` tests what follows
# `unique_window =`, and `basis == "deleted_at"` in `repository.rs` tests a
# retention basis. Neither comparand reads as a value, so defaulting the
# unknown case to "key" admitted both and let `#[job(pending = true)]` pass. The same shape
# spells out values elsewhere — `repository.rs` matches `"destroy"`,
# `"delete_all"`, `"nullify"` and `"restrict"` as the spellings accepted after
# `on_delete =`, inside `parse_repo_args` itself — and reading those arms let
# `#[repository(Post, delete_all = true)]` pass, while reading none of them
# lost `authorize`'s two real keys. What the scrutinee was built from settles
# it: `key.get_ident()` dispatches keys, `nested.value()?` dispatches values.
#
# One key belongs to every macro and appears in no owner file:
# `crate_path::extract_crate_override` strips `crate = "…"` before any parser
# runs, and all 33 entry points call it. Omitting it made the supported
# `#[get("/x", crate = "autumn_web_05")]` report as drift.
#
# **Where** those patterns are read matters as much as what they match. Run
# over a whole source file they are far too generous: `model.rs` is ~10k lines
# of codegen, and reading all of it accepted `username`, `mouse` and `goose` as
# `#[model(...)]` keys — so `#[model(username = "x")]` passed a corpus run
# clean. `parse_attr_args`, the function that actually parses that attribute,
# takes `table` and `managed`.
#
# So extraction is scoped to the macro's own argument parser, found
# structurally rather than by name: the function whose signature takes the raw
# `attr: TokenStream` but NOT `item: TokenStream`. That is the dedicated arg
# parser; the one taking both is the macro entry point, which reaches the
# entire implementation. Alongside it, the `syn::Parse` impl for the type the
# macro parses its arguments into — `api_doc` and `agent_operable` parse that
# way and have no attr-taking function at all, so without it `api_doc` had no
# readable grammar across 53 guide examples and `agent_operable` fell back to
# its whole macro entry and accepted `cfg`, `fn` and `jobs` as keys. The two
# are additive rather than a fallback chain. No macro in the corpus currently
# has both — `static_get`, the case that motivated the union, turned out not
# to use the shared route parser at all — so the union is inert today and is
# kept for its failure direction: a dropped root narrows the accepted set and
# reports correct pages as drift, while a superfluous one only widens it and
# costs a miss. A `Parse` root is the implementing TYPE, never the
# bare method name — `code_blocks` groups same-named methods together, so
# rooting at `parse` dragged `EffectSpec::parse` in beside
# `OperableAttr::parse`. Only when neither exists does the macro entry serve.
#
# From the root the reader follows calls transitively into other functions and
# `impl` blocks, so a grammar split across helpers (`job.rs`'s
# `parse_basic_arg` / `parse_uniqueness_arg` / `parse_concurrency_arg`) is read
# whole.
#
# Three things bound that walk, each because ignoring it produced a wrong
# answer on this corpus:
#
#   - **A block parsing a nested group's grammar is not read.**
#     `Attribute::parse_nested_meta` parses an attribute's own arguments;
#     `ParseNestedMeta::parse_nested_meta` descends into a group, and the
#     receiver says which. Reading the descents promoted `action` (inside
#     `dependent(…)`) and `after`/`basis` (inside `retention(…)`) to top-level
#     `#[repository]` keys and let `#[repository(Post, action = true)]` pass.
#     Nesting *depth* could not tell them apart: `parse_repo_args` enters its
#     own top level through `syn::meta::parser`, not through a
#     `parse_nested_meta` call, so every such call in it is already a descent.
#
#   - **A callee is followed only if it receives the attribute** in some syn
#     form (`ParseNestedMeta`, `Meta`, `TokenStream`, `Attribute`, …). One
#     taking a bare `&str` is parsing a *value* already handed to it, and its
#     literals are values: `DependentAction::parse(action: &str)` matches
#     `delete_all`, `destroy`, `nullify` and `restrict`, which are spellings
#     accepted *after* `dependent =`, never keys of `#[model(...)]`. Following
#     it let `#[model(delete_all = true)]` pass.
#   - **A macro's grammar may span files.** The route verbs dispatch from
#     `route.rs` but parse their keys in the shared `parse.rs`, so a
#     single-file read reported `#[get(api_version = "v1")]` — three correct
#     pages of `docs/guide/api-versioning.md` — as drift. `OWNERS` therefore
#     takes a tuple where one file is not the whole story.
#
# Symmetrically, only the attribute's **own** keys are judged: a nested group
# carries its own grammar, so `#[get("/about", seo(title = …, og_type = …))]`
# names `title` and `og_type` as keys of `seo(...)`. Judging them against
# `#[get]` reported three correct SEO pages as drift. Nested grammars are not
# checked at all, which is the safe direction.
#
# The union is still deliberately permissive within that scope. A gate that
# reports a key the macro does accept is worse than one that misses a key it
# doesn't: the first teaches readers to distrust the gate and gets waived away
# wholesale, the second only fails to catch what nothing was catching before.
# Every narrowing below is there because the permissive read produced a false
# positive on this corpus:
#
#   - **A macro whose grammar the extractor cannot read is skipped, not
#     failed.** If the scope yields zero keys, this gate cannot judge that
#     macro's arguments and says so under `--list` rather than reporting every
#     key its pages use. Three are skipped today — `mailer_preview`, `service`
#     and `sim_test` — and the other 30 are judged. A macro whose parser was
#     *found* but yields no keys is a different case: it is a marker like
#     `#[public]`, `crate` is its whole grammar, and it is judged on that
#     alone. Knowing there is nothing is not the same as knowing nothing —
#     though it can also be a *forwarder*: `oauth2_callback` hands its
#     arguments to `route::route_macro`, so reading only its own file left it
#     with `crate` alone and reported a valid `timeout_ms` as drift. A
#     self-test checks the registry covers every macro entry a macro forwards
#     `attr` to, rather than trusting the marker inference. The self-test
#     holds a floor under that count so a refactor cannot quietly empty the
#     truth set, the failure mode where a gate keeps passing because it
#     stopped looking, and a second case fails if `lib.rs` exports a macro
#     `OWNERS` does not name: an unregistered macro is not a permissive read
#     but no read at all.
#   - **Only fenced Rust is read.** `docs/guide/agent-authority.md` discusses a
#     `#[repository(.., grant = X)]` key in prose as an explicitly-named
#     follow-up that does not exist yet. That is a correct sentence about a
#     missing feature, and reporting it would be reporting the docs for being
#     accurate. Prose names keys; fences hand them over to be pasted, and only
#     the second is a thing a reader copies.
#   - **`==` is not a keyword argument.** `#[cfg(feature = "db")]`-style keys
#     are matched by `key =` but a comparison inside a macro argument is not,
#     hence the `=(?!=)` lookahead.
#   - **A bare flag is an argument; a positional is not.** `#[job(unique)]` and
#     `#[model(managed)]` take no value, and a typo in one fails the build
#     exactly like a mistyped key — reading only `key =` left `#[job(uniqe)]`
#     passing clean. But the type in `#[repository(Post, …)]`, the role literal
#     in `#[secured("admin")]` and the value in `resource = Post` are
#     positional, so literals and nested groups are collapsed to a placeholder
#     before the split and a segment carrying `=` yields only its left side.
#   - **A delimiter inside a literal or a comment is data, not structure.** The
#     depth scan skips `"…"`, `'…'`, `r#"…"#`, `// …` and (nesting) `/* … */`
#     before counting, so neither `#[secured("admin)", policy = "x")]` nor
#     `#[secured(/* ) */ policy = "x")]` ends at that `)`. Any argument
#     carrying a route pattern, regex or glob has the same shape.
#
# Two misses are open and known, both on the accepted side of that trade-off:
#
#   - `#[job(Uniqe)]`, an upper-case misspelling of a bare flag, is not
#     reported. The pattern that would catch it is the same one keeping
#     `#[repository(Post, …)]`'s leading TYPE from being read as a flag, and
#     widening it reports `Post` on a form the corpus documents throughout.
#     Closing it needs a hand-maintained list of which macros take a positional
#     type, and judging that by resemblance is how `static_get` and `ws` were
#     both registered wrong.
#   - Several `#[doc = "…"]` attributes on ONE physical line, the last followed
#     by the item, are read one deep: the first expands, and the rest go back
#     as ordinary source. rustdoc concatenates all of them, so a fence spanning
#     them goes unread. Closing it means re-entering the expansion on the tail.
#   - An info string is classified by its first token, so ```` ```text,rust ````
#     and ```` ```{.rust} ```` — both of which `rustdoc --test` collects — read
#     as non-Rust and go unscanned. Closing it means implementing rustdoc's
#     whole info-string grammar rather than the token this reads today.
#
# ── Corpus ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Two halves, because this defect class lived in both:
#
#   1. The tracked markdown a reader browses — the guide, README, EXAMPLES,
#      CONTRIBUTING, and the `skills/` references the agent machinery loads by
#      name.
#   2. The rustdoc of every publishable crate, which ships to docs.rs. Two of
#      the five baseline defects were here, and they are the ones a reader is
#      most likely to trust: docs.rs is where you land when you look up the
#      type, and an ```ignore fence looks exactly like a compiled one.
#
# The archive trees are excluded for the same reason the sibling gates exclude
# them (`check-docs-toml.sh` states it at length): `docs/plans/`, `docs/adr/`,
# `docs/design/`, `docs/stories/`, `docs/reports/`, `docs/releases/`,
# `docs/migrations/`, `docs/schemas/`, `docs/perf/` and the dated brainstorming
# notes record what was proposed or shipped at a point in time. A migration
# guide's `# 0.3.x` block is *supposed* to show the spelling that no longer
# works; gating it would force the record to lie.
#
# Test trees are excluded from the rustdoc half: `autumn/tests/compile-fail/`
# exists to hold code that must not compile.
#
# ── Waivers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A passage that must name a key this gate rejects — another framework's
# spelling shown for comparison, or a key whose macro landed after this ran —
# waives it beside the passage, with the reason:
#
#     <!-- macro-arg-allow: secured.policy — Spring's name; Autumn spells it
#          scopes = ["…"] -->
#
# In Rust source the same marker goes in a line comment. The waiver names
# `<macro>.<key>` so a waiver for one macro's key cannot silently bless
# another's.
#
# "Beside the passage" is enforced, not merely advised: a marker covers the
# fence it is inside, or else the next one to open within `WAIVER_REACH` lines,
# and is then spent. Applying that window independently to every fence let one
# marker waive several — two consecutive one-line fences both sit within six
# lines of a marker written for the first. Collapsing every marker in a file to one `(macro, key)` set
# would mean a single legitimate waiver near the top of a long guide silently
# accepting every later use of that key on the page, including an unrelated
# typo — a waiver that reads as local but behaves as a file-wide opt-out.
#
# Run locally with:
#

# shipped rustdoc (`autumn/src/aggregate.rs`, `autumn/src/classify/mod.rs`).
# Requiring the bare name would leave every qualified invocation ungated.
# Rust permits whitespace between an attribute path and its delimiter, so
# `#[secured (policy = "x")]` is a valid invocation the macro still rejects.
# A comment is a token separator like whitespace, so Rust accepts one anywhere
# whitespace goes: `#[/* a */ secured /* b */ (policy = "x")]` is a real
# invocation. The two gaps inside an attribute head — after `#[` and before the
# delimiter — are therefore walked by `_trivia_end` rather than matched by the
# regex, because a regex separator means `\s*` and `\s*` does not know what a
# comment is. Writing one that did would also have to give up nested block
# comments, which `skip_comment` already handles.
# `#` and `[` are separate tokens, so trivia goes between them too:
# `# /* rationale */ [secured(policy = "x")]` compiles and applies the
# attribute. Verified with rustc rather than assumed. There are three gaps in
# an attribute head, not two, and all three are walked the same way.

# name. Both restrictions are load-bearing rather than tidiness:
#
#   `#[::secured(…)]`                                    — a crate NAMED

#
# Widening the path to "any segments ending in a known name" would report the

# `::` is a token like any other, so trivia goes around it too:

FAIL: the docs hand a reader an Autumn attribute macro with a keyword argument
that macro does not parse (above).

The reader pastes the annotation onto their own handler and the build stops on
their file, quoting a grammar they were copying in good faith from the page
that taught it to them. Nothing compiles these fences — rustdoc's ```ignore
blocks and markdown fences alike — so the spelling can be copied forward from
one page into four before anybody types it.

Fix each one where it lives:
  - wrong key       -> use the key the macro parses (the `accepts:` line lists
                       them, read out of the macro's own source)
  - key not shipped -> land the macro change first; this gate reads
                       `autumn-macros/src/`, so a new key needs no snapshot
                       update
  - another framework's name, shown for comparison -> waive it beside the
                       passage, with the Autumn spelling in the reason:

      <!-- macro-arg-allow: secured.policy — Spring's name; Autumn spells it
           scopes = ["…"] -->
