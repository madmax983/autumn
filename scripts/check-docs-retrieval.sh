# Retrieval gate: every reader question in the fixture must land on the page
# that answers it, using only the words the asker would type.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus already gates eleven things about a page a reader
# HAS REACHED — its links (`check-docs-links.sh`, a 404), its commands
# (`check-docs-cli.sh`), the `AUTUMN_*` variables it tells them to SET
# (`check-docs-config.sh`), the `autumn.toml` keys it tells them to WRITE
# (`check-docs-toml.sh`), the `autumn_web::…` paths they IMPORT
# (`check-docs-symbols.sh`), the `/actuator/…` URLs they CURL
# (`check-docs-routes.sh`), the macro arguments they copy
# (`check-docs-macro-args.sh`), the Cargo feature a gated snippet needs
# (`check-docs-features.sh`), the dependency pin all of it is relative to
# (`check-docs-versions.sh`), and the agreement between those corpora
# (`check-docs-scope.sh`). `check-docs-orphans.sh` adds the one thing that is
# not about the page's contents: that the page can be REACHED AT ALL, by
# clicking, from a surface a reader enters through.
#
# Reachable is not the same as findable. `check-docs-orphans.sh` proves a path
# exists from the README to the page. It cannot ask the question a reader
# actually arrives with, which is not "which link do I click" but "what do I
# type". A reader mid-task does not read a 162-entry index; they search their
# own words, and a page whose title and headings are spelled in the project's
# vocabulary instead of theirs is invisible to that search while remaining
# perfectly reachable, perfectly accurate, and perfectly linked. Every other
# gate stays green over it.
#
# The baseline run found exactly that. `docs/guide/logging-pii.md` carries the
# answer to "how do I change the log level" — `[log] level`, `log.format`, the
# access log switch — under the title "Logging & PII", and the README lists it
# under that name. The words "log level" appeared in the title or a heading of
# none of the 162 guide pages, so the question returned nothing, while the
# `[log]` section itself appeared in 9 fences across 7 pages. The runtime half
# of the same question — `PUT /actuator/loggers/{name}`, which changes a live
# `tracing` subscriber without a redeploy — appeared on NO reader-facing page
# at all: it was documented in `skills/autumn-web/SKILL.md` (a context pack for
# agents, not a page a person lands on), named in one comparison-table row, and
# otherwise mentioned only in `deployment.md`'s list of endpoints production
# turns OFF.
#
# HOW IT MODELS RETRIEVAL. A page announces itself to a search in three places,
# in descending weight: its slug (the filename, which is also the URL), its H1,
# and its other headings. Body text is deliberately NOT searched: a word buried
# in paragraph nine is what "the answer is in there somewhere" means, and it is
# the defect this gate exists to catch, not the pass condition. A question
# matches a page when every content word in the question appears in one of
# those three places on that page.
#
# Matching is deliberately crude — casefold, split on non-alphanumerics, drop a
# short stopword list, fold a trailing plural `s`. A reader's query is crude
# too, and a cleverer matcher would start passing questions a real search
# engine would fail.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS THE EVIDENCE. `scripts/docs-retrieval-questions.tsv` pairs a
# question with the page that answers it. A question is added when a reader
# failure is observed, not because a page looks like it deserves one, and it is
# removed only with the page. Because the fixture pins the ANSWERING page and
# not merely "some hit", a retitle that makes a page findable to a different
# question fails here rather than silently re-aiming it.
#
# WHAT A FAILURE MEANS. A question that lands nowhere, or lands on a page other
# than the one that answers it, is a findability defect, and the fix is a
# retitle, a heading, or a crosslink — rung 4. It is NOT a new page: a second
# page answering the same question splits the rank that would have let a reader
# find either, and the corpus then carries both forever.
#
# Run locally with:
#
#     ./scripts/check-docs-retrieval.sh
#     ./scripts/check-docs-retrieval.sh --list       # every question and where it lands
#     ./scripts/check-docs-retrieval.sh --self-test  # the matcher's own tests

FAIL: a reader question does not reach the page that answers it (listed above).

The answer exists and is right; the page does not say so in the words the
asker types. Fix it at the lowest rung that closes it:

  - the page's H1 or slug is spelled in project vocabulary
      -> retitle the H1 in the reader's words (do NOT rename the file: the
         path is the URL, and inbound links are the corpus's most valuable
         asset)
  - the answer is on the page but under no heading of its own
      -> give it a heading in the reader's words
  - the answer is genuinely split across pages
      -> fold it onto the strongest page and crosslink from the others

Do NOT add a new page. A second page answering the same question splits the
rank that would have let a reader find either, and both then drift.
