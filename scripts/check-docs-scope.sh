# Corpus-scope agreement gate: the docs drift gates must not disagree about
# which pages are reader-facing.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: four gates each answer a different question about the same
# set of pages — `check-docs-cli.sh` (the `autumn …` commands a reader copies),
# `check-docs-config.sh` (the `AUTUMN_*` variables), `check-docs-symbols.sh`
# (the `autumn_web::…` paths) and `check-docs-routes.sh` (the `/actuator/…`
# URLs). Each spells its own corpus as a tuple of path prefixes, and three of
# them carry a comment saying the definitions "are kept identical on purpose,
# since a page covered by one gate and not the other is how a page ends up with
# no owner."
#
# Nothing enforced that. The definitions drifted:
#
#   `.claude/skills/` is a second skill tree — the agent machinery loads a
#   `SKILL.md` there by name, and `run-autumn` lives only there. It was added to
#   `check-docs-routes.sh` (with the argument that its SKILL.md "drives a real
#   server with `curl`, so its actuator paths are the most literally copy-and-run
#   text in the tree") and to `check-docs-orphans.sh`'s entry surfaces, and never
#   to the other three. `check-docs-toml.sh` and `check-docs-macro-args.sh` read
#   the whole tracked corpus, so they covered it all along. The result: five of
#   the eight docs gates treated the tree as reader-facing and three did not, so
#   that SKILL.md's `autumn seed --package`, `autumn routes --bin`,
#   `AUTUMN_SERVER__PORT` and `AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL` were ungated — while the
#   same file already carried `route-surface-allow` waivers for the gate that did
#   read it. A rename on either surface would have rotted there silently.
#
# The drift was invisible because it lives in four files that are never read
# side by side. This gate reads them side by side.
#
# Two more divergences turned up once this gate existed, and they are the reason
# it compares the file lists the gates REPORT rather than rules read out of their
# source. A corpus is widened in several places at once, so a checker that models
# some of them reports agreement over the rest:
#
#   - `check-docs-cli.sh` passed `*.md` to `git ls-files` where its three
#     siblings passed `*.md` AND `*.md.tmpl`, so
#     `autumn-cli/src/templates/README.md.tmpl` — the README `autumn new` writes
#     into every scaffolded project, carrying a reference table of `autumn dev`,
#     `autumn migrate`, `autumn doctor`, `autumn routes`, `autumn generate
#     scaffold` and `autumn release init` — sat outside the one gate that exists
#     to check `autumn …` commands. Identical tuples, different corpora.
#
#   - `check-docs-routes.sh` reads the `readme = "…"` page of every crate
#     manifest, because a crates.io landing page is reader-facing by PUBLICATION
#     rather than by where it sits in the tree. Its three siblings did not, so
#     the seven published plugin and subcrate READMEs were ungated for the
#     `autumn_web::…` paths and `AUTUMN_*` variables they carry — 18 symbol
#     occurrences and 3 variables, none of them drifted yet.
#
# Both are fixed in the same change as this gate: the siblings' corpus goes
# 200 -> 207, and all four gates stay green over it.
#
# THE INVARIANT, in two halves, over the set of files each gate actually reads:
#
#   1. `check-docs-cli.sh`, `check-docs-config.sh`, `check-docs-symbols.sh` and
#      `check-docs-versions.sh` read the SAME PAGES. These ask about different
#      things a reader copies off one page — the command, the `AUTUMN_*`
#      variable, the `autumn_web::…` path, the `autumn-* = "0.7"` pin — and a
#      page that is reader-facing for one of them is reader-facing for all.
#      `check-docs-versions.sh` was registered here in the commit that added it,
#      not after its corpus had a chance to drift: it copies the same scope
#      block, and copying is precisely what this file exists to watch.
#
#   2. Every page `check-docs-routes.sh` reads that the siblings do not, or the
#      reverse, is DECLARED below in `DECLARED_DIFFERENCES` — with the DIRECTION
#      the difference runs in, so a note cannot outlive the thing it describes
#      and waive its own opposite.
#
# Half 2 is the half that catches the drift described above, and it is why this
# gate does not simply require the routes corpus to be a superset. A superset
# rule permits exactly what happened: `.claude/skills/` was added to the wider
# gate alone, the three siblings still agreed with each other, and a
# superset check passes that state happily. The rule has to be that a
# difference is *written down*, not that a difference is allowed — because the
# useful moment is the one where someone widens one gate, and the question
# "does this argument carry to the other three?" is asked while they still have
# the answer in their head.
#
# So a new divergence fails until its author either propagates it or records why
# it does not propagate. Today exactly one difference is declared: the routes
# gate reads all of `examples/`, not just the `README.md` under it, because
# `examples/wiki/content/` is embedded and SERVED — a stale URL there is not a
# page a reader might open, it is a page the running example shows them. That
# argument is about URLs and does not carry to commands or config keys, so the
# difference is deliberate and stays.
#
# This gate reads no page's CONTENT. It runs each registered gate with the
# `--corpus` mode this change adds to them, which prints that gate's own
# resolved corpus one path per line, and compares the lists. It therefore fails
# at the moment a scope is edited rather than when a page that scope stopped
# covering finally rots.
#
# THE GATES ARE ASKED, NOT MODELLED. The first version of this script re-derived
# each corpus by parsing the gate's source, and was wrong twice over in exactly
# the way a model is always eventually wrong: it compared the scope tuples and
# reported agreement while the `ls-files` globs differed, and once the globs
# were modelled too it still had no idea the routes gate reads crate manifests.
# Every rule a corpus is built from would have had to be mirrored here and kept
# mirrored — a second implementation with its own drift, gating the first. So a
# gate answers for itself.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE: agreement is not correctness. It compares the
# gates against each other, so a blindness they SHARE is invisible to it — if
# every gate's corpus rule misses the same page, they all agree and this passes.
# That is not hypothetical — the shared manifest parser produced three of these
# in a row, each invisible here and each caught only by review:
#
#   - it read only double-quoted `readme = "…"`, so a single-quoted path
#     resolved to nothing in all four;
#   - it used the resolved set only to FILTER a markdown glob, so a published
#     `README.rst` could not enter any of the four;
#   - it ignored Cargo's implicit discovery, so a crate that simply omits the
#     key — which two publishable crates here are not required to declare —
#     published a landing page no gate owned.
#
# So a rule copied into all four gates still needs to be right on its own terms.
# This gate only promises they do not diverge.
#
# A gate whose `--corpus` fails, or prints nothing, is a FAILURE and never a
# skip: an empty corpus compares equal to another empty corpus, and a gate that
# silently stops being checked is the defect this gate exists to catch, one
# level up.
#
# A declaration is kept alive only by a difference IT matched — the
# bookkeeping is by index, not by prefix. Two entries can share a prefix, the
# live one plus a dead entry for the opposite direction, and keying on the
# prefix string let a match on either mark BOTH used, so the staleness check
# passed the dead one.
#
# THE DECLARATIONS ARE CHECKED TOO, before any corpus is read: a prefix, a
# direction, a claim per side drawn from a fixed vocabulary, and a NON-EMPTY
# REASON. The reason is enforced rather than merely conventional because this
# gate's premise is that a difference gets written down — and for three
# revisions `why` was decorative, so deleting the prose while keeping the keys
# left the gate green and the exception unexplained. A rule that is never
# checked is a rule that is eventually not followed, which is the observation
# this whole script is built on.

# `check-docs-versions.sh` joins as a sibling in the commit that adds it, rather

# `INCLUDE_DIRS`/`INCLUDE_FILES`/`package_readmes` block the other three carry,
# and the whole argument of this file is that copying is exactly what needs
# watching: a fifth spelling of "reader-facing", unwatched, is how the three
# divergences in the header happened.
#
# `check-docs-features.sh` joins on the same terms, in the same commit that adds
# it. It asks the sixth question about one page — whether the page names the
# Cargo feature the Rust it shows needs — and a page that is reader-facing for
# the `autumn_web::…` path in a fence is reader-facing for the feature that path
# is behind. The two gates read the same fences; splitting their corpora would
# put an item under one owner and its enabling line under none.

#
# `side` and the claims are what keep a declaration from outliving the thing it
# describes — twice now, a looser key let this note waive something it was never
# written about:
#
#   - Keyed by path alone, it waived its own OPPOSITE. Removing `examples/` from
#     the routes gate makes it narrower than its siblings, a real loss of
#     coverage and the reverse of what is written here, and the lookup still
#     matched. Hence `side`.
#
#   - Keyed by path and side, it waived any ONE file under the prefix and
#     counted itself used. The routes gate could stop reading
#     `examples/wiki/content/` — the served pages this note exists for — and
#     gain some unrelated `examples/todo/NOTES.md` instead, and the declaration
#     would sail through on the replacement while the coverage it claims was
#     gone. Hence the claims, which are CHECKED against the tracked tree rather
#     than trusted: a declaration has to keep being true, not merely keep
#     matching something.
# A claim is a function of the pages under a prefix AND the pages every gate
# agrees on, because "which of these is a README" is not answerable from the
# filename alone. A crate may publish any file it names — `README.rst`, or a
# `GUIDE.md` — so a fixed list of Cargo's conventional names rejected a
# legitimately published page and failed the gate over a corpus that agreed.
# Unanimity answers it instead: a published landing page is resolved by all
# four gates, so it arrives in `agreed`, while a page only some gates report
# does not and still has to be explained.
