#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Symbol drift gate: every workspace-crate path the reader-facing docs put in
# front of someone must name an item that exists — and live in a crate a reader
# can actually import.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the corpus already gates the four things a reader copies off
# a page and the one thing they cannot copy at all.
# `scripts/check-docs-links.sh` gates its *links* (a 404),
# `scripts/check-docs-cli.sh` its *commands* (`unrecognized subcommand`),
# `scripts/check-docs-config.sh` the `AUTUMN_*` variables they SET (a silent
# no-op), `scripts/check-docs-toml.sh` the `autumn.toml` keys they WRITE
# (dropped silently), and `scripts/check-docs-orphans.sh` asserts the page can
# be reached at all. Nothing gated the thing the guide is mostly MADE of: Rust.
#
# The reader-facing corpus names 1,495 `autumn_web::…` paths — 864 of them
# inside `rust` fences, the rest in prose a reader reads as authoritative — a
# larger copy-surface than the env layer (689 occurrences) and the `autumn.toml`
# layer (172 fences) combined. A renamed or never-shipped item leaves behind a
# line that looks exactly like a working one, and nothing in the tree could tell
# the difference.
#
# WIDENED FROM `autumn_web::` TO EVERY PUBLISHED CRATE. For its first several
# revisions this gate scanned one prefix, `autumn_web::`, even though it already
# MODELLED `autumn_macros`, `autumn_edge` and `autumn_search` — it had to, to
# follow an `autumn_web` re-export into them. The gap that left is the whole
# reason for the widening: the sibling crates are how a reader adopts a plugin
# (`use autumn_billing::BillingPlugin;`, `use autumn_storage_s3::S3BlobStore;`),
# the corpus writes 67 such paths, and not one of them was a passing check. They
# were not checked at all. A path into a sibling fails exactly the way an
# `autumn_web::` one does — E0432 against the reader's own file — so there was
# never a reason for the two to be gated differently, only an accident of which
# prefix got written first.
#
# Widening it meant seeding resolution with the crate the path NAMES instead of
# `autumn_web` unconditionally. That single hardcoded root was wrong in both
# directions, and the self-test now pins both: a real item in a sibling crate
# resolved against `autumn_web` is a false FAILURE, and — worse — a sibling path
# that happens to collide with an `autumn_web` module would have passed while
# naming something that does not exist where the reader is looking.
#
# AND THE CLASS THAT NO RENAME FIXES: a crate with no library target. See
# `binary_only_crates` — `autumn-cli` is `src/main.rs` and nothing else, so
# `pub` inside it is visible only within the binary. The baseline run of the
# widened gate found the corpus's one instance, and it is the nastiest shape
# here: `docs/guide/accessibility.md` offered a "Programmatic use" section whose
# `use autumn_cli::check::{A11yCheckOptions, run_a11y_check, print_report};`
# names a module that is real, items that are real and really `pub`, in a crate
# `cargo add` installs without complaint. Every signal a reader has says the
# line is fine. What does not exist is a library to import it from, and no
# spelling of the path fixes that — which is why it is reported as its own
# defect class rather than as a dead segment with a `did you mean` hint.
#
# WHERE IT SITS ON THE VISIBILITY SCALE: both ends of it, which is the reason
# to gate the whole surface rather than the import lines alone.
#
# In most positions an unresolved path is a compile error — LOUD, like a bad
# link or a bad command. That does not make it cheap: `rustc` reports it
# against the READER's file, not against the page, so they are told their code
# is wrong when the documentation is, at the first build of a feature they have
# not used before. `docs/guide/maintenance-mode.md` is that case: it hands over
# `use autumn_web::middleware::{MaintenanceLayer, MaintenanceState};` and only
# the first of the two is there. `MaintenanceState` lives in
# `autumn_web::maintenance`, a DIFFERENT module that happens to have a
# same-named sibling under `middleware::maintenance`, so the reader gets E0432
# on a line where half the import is right.
#
# But some positions are SILENT, and they are the ones no reader can defend
# against. `#[autumn_web::main]` parses the function it decorates and emits
# `fn main()` fresh (`autumn-macros/src/main_macro.rs`): `input_fn.sig` is read
# only to check `async`, and the declared return type is never re-emitted. So
# in the FIRST fence of `docs/guide/api-versioning.md`,
#
#     async fn main() -> Result<(), autumn_web::Error> {
#
# the name `autumn_web::Error` never reaches name resolution at all. There is no
# such type — the crate root exports `AutumnError` and `AutumnResult` — and
# the snippet still builds. The reader copies a working example and carries away
# the wrong name for the framework's error type, with nothing anywhere to
# correct them. That is the `AUTUMN_*` failure mode exactly: not a dead end the
# reader can see, but a confident wrong answer they cannot.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (single fast job, no Rust toolchain needed):
#   1. Every `autumn_web::a::b::C` path a reader-facing page names resolves
#      through the crate's real module tree to an item that exists — including
#      when the page writes it brace-grouped (`autumn_web::{get, post}`), which
#      is how most import lines in the guide are written — including the 14
#      groups that nest (`storage::{BlobStoreState, variant::{Transform, …}}`)
#      or run across lines, whose symbols a line-at-a-time reader never sees.
#   2. Resolution follows what Rust actually does, not what the source looks
#      like, because a documented path is almost never a path to where the item
#      is DEFINED:
#        - `pub use` re-exports, including aliased ones (`pub use http_client
#          as http` is why `autumn_web::http::Client` is a real path and
#          `autumn_web::http_client::Client` is the one nobody writes),
#        - glob re-exports (`pub use prelude::*`),
#        - re-exports THROUGH a private module, which is the normal facade
#          shape here (`ui/mod.rs` is the only public thing between the reader
#          and `pub const WIDGETS_CSS_PATH` in a private `widgets_css`),
#        - `#[macro_export]` macros, which land at the CRATE ROOT no matter
#          which module they are written in, so `autumn_web::declassify` is
#          correct for a macro defined in `classify/mod.rs`,
#        - inline `mod x { … }` blocks, which is where the feature-gated
#          `db_impl` facades put `Lock`, `LockGuard` and friends,
#        - paths that leave the crate into a sibling in this workspace
#          (`autumn_macros`, `autumn_edge`, `autumn_search`), which is where
#          every attribute macro a handler is decorated with actually lives,
#          including a whole crate re-exported under an alias
#          (`pub use autumn_edge as edge`),
#        - the TYPE namespace winning for traversal where one name is both a
#          module and a value: `pub mod app` beside `pub use app::app`, and
#          `pub use autumn_edge as edge` beside `pub use autumn_macros::edge`.
#          Letting the value win turns every path under it into an unchecked
#          "associated item".
#   3. VISIBILITY, which is the difference between an item existing and a reader
#      being able to name it. Only bare `pub` counts: `autumn/src/lib.rs` has 49
#      `pub(crate)`/`pub(super)` modules, and a path through one is E0603 in the
#      reader's crate however public the item inside it is. `route` is
#      `pub(crate) mod` while `Route` is re-exported at the crate root, so
#      `::autumn_web::Route` is right and `::autumn_web::route::Route` — which
#      `macro-transparency.md` showed as the macro's own output — is not.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK:
#   - Anything past the first item segment. `AutumnError::not_found_msg` is
#     checked as far as `AutumnError`; associated functions, methods, trait
#     items and enum variants need type resolution, and guessing at them is how
#     a gate starts reporting confident nonsense.
#   - Paths that leave the workspace. `autumn_web::reexports::axum::…`,
#     `autumn_web::PreEscaped` (maud) and `autumn_web::db::Pool` (diesel) are
#     real re-exports of crates whose source is not in this tree, so the gate
#     records them as OPAQUE and says so rather than pretending to have checked
#     them. 57 of the 1,495 occurrences land here; `--list` prints all of them,
#     because an opaque count that grows quietly is how a gate goes hollow.
#   - Feature gates. The surface is read as a superset with every `#[cfg]`
#     ignored, so a path that only exists under `--features ws` still resolves.
#     Gating on the default feature set would report an item a reader can
#     absolutely use as missing; that direction of error is not worth trading
#     for, and `check-docs.sh` already builds the real posture.
#   - Bare identifiers. A fence that writes `TestApp::build()` after a
#     `use autumn_web::prelude::*` names no path, and inferring one would need
#     the compiler.
#
# TRUTH SET: the crate sources themselves (`autumn/src`, `autumn-macros/src`,
# `autumn-edge/src`, `autumn-search/src`). There is no snapshot to regenerate
# and nothing to keep in sync — a rename lands in the same commit as the
# surface it renames, which is the property that makes this gate cheap to keep.
#
# WAIVERS — rules, not a list of paths. A page SHOWS a path as often as it tells
# someone to write one, and in output a module path is a label to read rather
# than a line to copy. Two shapes are read as output:
#
#   - The CELL carrying a compiler error code — not the whole row.
#     `docs/migrations/TEMPLATE.md` carries the migration cheat-sheet row
#
#       | `error[E0432]: unresolved import `autumn_web::foo`` | … | `use …;` |
#
#     whose first cell exists to display a path that does not resolve. The next
#     cell gives the FIX, and a fix is a live recommendation: `0.7.0.md` pairs
#     ``error[E0063]: missing field `seo` …`` with
#     `autumn_web::seo::SeoRouteDefaults::EMPTY`, and waiving the whole row
#     would leave unchecked the one path in it a reader actually copies. So the
#     exemption runs from the error code to the end of its own table cell.
#   - A log line (`INFO`, `WARN`, …). The path in one is the tracing TARGET that
#     emitted it — the module's real position in the crate, routinely a private
#     one. `docs/guide/bot-protection.md` quotes the crate's own startup log,
#     `INFO  autumn_web::router: bot_protection provider=…`, and `router` is
#     `pub(crate) mod`: correct as output, unwritable as a path.
#
#   - A migration guide's **Before** block. It quotes what the reader wrote
#     against the previous release, so where the release REMOVED the item the
#     path is dead on purpose -- that removal is what the section announces.
#     `next.md`'s #2809 section shows `#[autumn_macros::model]` as the old
#     spelling; `model` is in `autumn-macros-model` now, and the block would
#     be wrong if it resolved. The **After** block beside it is the live
#     recommendation and stays audited, as a cheat-sheet row's FIX cell does.
#
# A fourth shape is not a path claim at all and is dropped before resolution
# rather than waived: a brace group containing `(`. A `use` group never does,
# and the skill's api-reference writes
# `autumn_web::widgets::{localized_path(path, locale), locale_switcher(path,
# current_locale, …)}` — prose listing SIGNATURES. Splitting that on commas
# invents `autumn_web::widgets::current_locale` out of an argument name, so the
# module prefix is kept as the claim and the group is discarded.
#
# All of these are rules because a named list would have to grow every time a
# guide quotes a real rename, a real log line, or removes an item; these do
# not.
#

def workspace_crates(root):
    """ident -> (src dir, has a library target), read from the workspace.

    DERIVED rather than listed, for the reason the plugin-root scan in
    `check-docs-toml.sh` is derived: a list of crates outlives the tree it
    describes. A new publishable crate has to be MODELLED (see
    `undeclared_crates`) or a reader can be handed a path into it that nothing
    resolves, and a crate that stops shipping a library has to stop being
    resolvable the same day.

    Only PUBLISHED members count, because a reader reaches a crate by depending
    on it, so a crate nobody can depend on is not a prefix anybody can write:
    that rules out the `examples/` and `benchmarks/` members, and also
    `example-e2e` and `autumn-plugin-reference`, which sit at the top level
    beside the real crates and would otherwise be demanded here as
    reader-facing surface.

    Publishability is `_published`, NOT a literal `publish is False` test of my
    own. Cargo spells "do not publish" three ways — `publish = false`,
    `publish = []`, and `publish.workspace = true` inheriting a `false` from
    `[workspace.package]` — and this file already had all three right in
    `_published`, for the corpus scan. A second, weaker copy here would read a
    private library as published and fail the gate as an undeclared crate,
    which is the self-maintaining check firing on the one shape it exists to
    tolerate.

    `members` accepts Cargo's globs (`crates/*`), and reading each entry as a
    literal directory silently drops every package a glob matches. That is not
    a missing check but a VOIDED one: `undeclared_crates` could no longer see
    those crates, so the "every published crate is modelled" guarantee would
    keep passing while covering none of them — the same
    unaudited-looks-like-clean failure as an unmatched `[lib] name`.

    `exclude` semantics are cargo's (`WorkspaceRootConfig::is_excluded`) and
    are not symmetrical with `members`: entries are literal path PREFIXES, so
    `exclude = ["crates/*"]` matches nothing, and an explicitly listed member
    always wins over an exclude. Mirrored from
    `scripts/check-example-bin-names.sh`, which worked these rules out first —
    the shape, not a second guess at it.

    IN-TREE PATH DEPENDENCIES ARE MEMBERS TOO, even when `members` does not
    name them — cargo's documented behaviour, and the reason this function
    walks them. An earlier revision of this gate deliberately did not, on the
    reasoning that a path dependency reflects what the workspace BUILDS rather
    than what it PUBLISHES. That reasoning was wrong: cargo makes such a
    dependency a real member, so a published one is a crate a reader can name,
    and omitting it left `undeclared_crates` green with that crate's whole
    prefix unaudited. Adding a published sibling through `path = "../new"`
    alone is enough to trigger it.

    Membership is NOT taken from `cargo metadata`, which would be the
    authoritative answer: this gate is a toolchain-free job that reports in
    seconds (see its step in ci.yml), and shelling out to cargo would cost
    that. The rules are mirrored from `scripts/check-example-bin-names.sh`
    instead, which resolved them first on #2712 — including the two that are
    easy to get wrong: a `[workspace.dependencies]` path is relative to the
    ROOT while a direct `path` is relative to the dependent package, and a
    dependency carrying its own `[workspace]` table is a separate workspace

    Returns a path rather than a boolean, because the file is the thing the

    "src/api.rs"` is a valid published library; classifying it as "has a lib"
    and then reading `src/lib.rs` anyway yields an EMPTY surface, and an empty
    surface does not fail — it reports every documented path into that crate as
    dead. Worse, `undeclared_crates` would have just instructed the author to
    map the crate, so the gate's own advice produces the wrong answer. (The
    empty-surface guard in `main` is the second half of that fix; a path is
    only useful if a missing one is loud.)

    Three cases, in the order Cargo resolves them:

      1. An explicit `[lib]` table declares one outright. Its `path` wins,
         defaulting to `src/lib.rs` when the table omits it. Checked first
         because `autolib` governs auto-DISCOVERY and says nothing about a
         target the manifest declares by hand.
      2. `package.autolib = false` turns auto-discovery off. A `src/lib.rs`
         then sits in the tree with no library built from it, so the file's
         presence is not proof and cannot be the last word.
      3. Otherwise Cargo auto-discovers `src/lib.rs`.

    Getting (2) wrong is not a cosmetic miss. A published package with
    `autolib = false` and a leftover `src/lib.rs` would be read as a library,
    so it would skip the binary-only class entirely: instead of the accurate
    "ships no library target", a path into it would be demanded as a modelled
    crate and then reported as an unresolved SYMBOL — sending the reader to
    look for a renamed item in a crate that exposes nothing at all.

# Workspace crates that ship NO library target, and so can never appear in a
# path a reader writes.
#
# `autumn-cli` is the whole class today: it is `src/main.rs` and nothing else,
# with no `src/lib.rs` and no `[lib]` section, so `pub` inside it is visible
# only within the binary. That is the nastiest shape this gate meets, because
# every OTHER signal a reader has says the path is fine — the module is real,
# the items are real and really `pub`, and `cargo add autumn-cli` succeeds,
# since the crate does publish a binary. What does not exist is a library to
# import, and no spelling of the path fixes that: the reader cannot route
# around it the way they can route around a renamed item.
#
# So a path into one is reported as its own defect rather than as a dead
# segment. "No `check` in `autumn_cli`" would be actively misleading advice —
# `autumn-cli/src/check.rs` is right there, `pub`, and the suggestion machinery
# would happily propose a near-miss inside a crate that cannot be imported at
# all. The answer is never a different path; it is the CLI, or an API the
# library crates actually expose.
#: Crate types a dependent crate can actually `use`. `cdylib` and `staticlib`
#: build an artifact for C, not an rlib for rustc, so a package whose only
#: crate types are those "provides no linkable target" (cargo says so in as
#: many words) and every `use pkg::Thing` against it is E0432 — even though
#: `src/lib.rs` is right there and this gate could resolve the path out of it.
#:
#: That is the SAME shape as the `autumn-cli` defect this gate was widened to
#: catch: a crate that reads as importable and is not. Different manifest key,
#: identical consequence for the reader, so it belongs in the same class rather
#: than in a check of its own.
#:
#: `proc-macro` is linkable and must stay so — `autumn-macros` is one, declared
#: as `[lib] proc-macro = true`, and its derives are named through re-exports
#: the resolver follows.

    explicit list answers for itself, and an empty one names nothing linkable.

    A non-list value is a manifest cargo itself rejects; it is read as the

    a docs defect out of this gate.

    missed the inline-table spelling of the inheritance it did match. Each fix
    was correct and each left the next corner of the same grammar uncovered,

    standard library and already used by `check-docs-toml.sh` and by
    `check-example-bin-names.sh`, the latter on `Cargo.toml` exactly like this.

    `cargo metadata` would be more authoritative still, and is deliberately not
    used: every docs gate shares a CI job that carries no Rust toolchain and no
    cache, on purpose, so that it reports in seconds and cannot be blocked by a
    compile failure elsewhere. Reading the manifests keeps that property.

    What Cargo does, and so does this: `readme = false` means none; a string is
    a path relative to the manifest; `workspace = true` takes the
    `[workspace.package]` value of the package's OWN workspace, relative to
    that workspace's root; and an ABSENT key discovers `README.md`,
    `README.txt` or `README` beside the manifest, in that order. A package that
    does not publish is skipped — it has no landing page to keep true, and
    enrolling its working notes made the drift gates fail on the illustrative

FAIL: the docs put a workspace-crate path in front of a reader that they cannot
write (above).

Where the path reaches name resolution, `rustc` reports it against the READER's
file, not against the page, so they are told their code is wrong when the
documentation is — at the first build of a feature they have not used before.
Where it does NOT (a return type under `#[autumn_web::main]`, which the macro
discards), nothing reports it at all and the reader simply carries away a name
that does not exist.

Fix each one where it lives:
  - no library     -> the crate ships only a binary (`autumn-cli`), so NO path
                      into it resolves and no rename helps. Document the
                      command, or an API a library crate exports.
  - renamed item   -> use the current name (the `did you mean` hint is the
                      closest name in the same module)
  - moved item     -> use the path a reader can actually write; it is usually a
                      re-export, not where the item is defined
                      (`autumn_web::http::Client`, not
                      `autumn_web::http_client::Client`)
  - never existed  -> drop it, or name the item that does the job
  - shown, not written -> a path inside a compiler-error line, a log line, or
                      a migration guide's **Before** block is already waived;
                      if you are illustrating a failure, quote the compiler
                      error with it
  - non-public     -> a `pub(crate)`/`pub(super)` module is E0603 for a reader
                      even when the item inside is re-exported at the crate
                      root: name the re-export (`::autumn_web::Route`, not
                      `::autumn_web::route::Route`)
