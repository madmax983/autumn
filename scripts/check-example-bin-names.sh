"""Verify that no two workspace members declare a binary target with the same
name (autumn #2639).

WHAT THE INVARIANT IS
  On Windows, the linker cannot replace an output file that is still open, so
  when two workspace members produce a binary with the same file name
  (e.g. `seed.exe`), whichever link starts second fails intermittently with
  LNK1104 "cannot open file". On Unix the collision is invisible
  (unlink-then-write), which is why it only ever surfaces on
  `Test (windows-latest)`.

WHAT IT CHECKS
  For every member of the workspace rooted at the repo root — the listed
  `[workspace].members` (globs expanded), the root package itself when the
  root manifest carries `[package]`, plus in-tree path dependencies, which
  cargo automatically treats as members even when `members` does not name them
  (including `[workspace.dependencies]`-inherited paths) —
  it enumerates the binary target names cargo would build, honoring cargo's
  auto-discovery rules (including the edition-2015 manual-target opt-out and
  `edition.workspace = true` inheritance). `[workspace].exclude` follows
  cargo's `WorkspaceRootConfig::is_excluded` exactly: entries are literal path
  prefixes (never globs), and an explicitly listed `members` entry always wins
  over `exclude`.

  - explicit `[[bin]]` entries in the member's Cargo.toml, plus
  - auto-discovered targets whenever `[package] autobins` is not `false`:
    `src/main.rs` (named after the package), `src/bin/*.rs` (named after the
    file stem), and `src/bin/<name>/main.rs` (named after the directory).

  An explicit `[[bin]]` does NOT disable auto-discovery (autumn #2690): only
  `autobins = false` does — except in edition 2015 (also the default when
  `edition` is omitted), where a manually specified target ([[bin]] or [lib])
  applies the legacy opt-out and disables auto-discovery, but ONLY when
  `[package] autobins` is left unspecified: an explicit `autobins = true`
  honors the explicit choice and keeps auto-discovery (autumn #2745). Auto-discovered paths already claimed by an
  explicit entry — via its `path`, or the default `src/bin/<name>.rs` when no
  `path` is given — are excluded so one target is not counted twice.

  It fails if the same name is claimed by more than one member. Names are
  compared case-insensitively: on Windows `Seed.exe` and `seed.exe` are the
  same output file, and this gate exists for the Windows linker.

WHY A SCRIPT
  The collision is timing-dependent, so CI only catches it when two links
  happen to overlap. A manifest gate catches the reintroduction at review
  time, deterministically, with no toolchain.

Run locally with:

    ./scripts/check-example-bin-names.sh              # self-test, then check
    ./scripts/check-example-bin-names.sh --self-test  # self-test only

The default invocation runs the self-test FIRST so a refactor that silently
stops catching things fails loud rather than going green on an empty scan.
