# Check that each individual autumn-web Cargo feature compiles in isolation, and
# that a curated set of representative real-world feature combinations compile,
# without building the full 2^N powerset (which is cost-prohibitive at ~35 flags).
#
# Bounded strategy:
#   Phase A — each-feature sweep via `cargo hack --each-feature`
#             This builds with default features, once with NO features, then once
#             per individual feature.  Linear in the number of features; ~31 builds
#             after exclusions.
#   Phase B — curated real-world combinations (5 fixed combos that mirror documented
#             user journeys: db-only API, minimal web, mail, storage+db, telemetry).
#             Each is a discrete `cargo check` so a failure names the exact
#             --features string.
#
# Excluded from Phase A (documented as unsupported-in-CI in STABILITY.md):
#   managed-pg          — downloads Postgres binaries on first run (CI build cost)
#   managed-pg-bundled  — embeds Postgres binaries into the binary (~150 MB, huge)
#   system-tests        — pulls chromiumoxide (headless Chromium)
#   test-support        — dev-only; pulls testcontainers
#
# telemetry-otlp requires protoc; it is swept in Phase A and also verified in
# Phase B. Install protoc with:
#   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler
# or use the workflow which installs it automatically.
#
# Called from the `feature-combinations` workflow. Run locally with:
#
#     cargo install cargo-hack            # one-time setup (if not already installed)
#     ./scripts/check-feature-combinations.sh
