# Migration-guide coverage gate (issue #1588).
#
# Autumn ships every 2-4 weeks and, pre-1.0, most releases can break existing
# apps. `docs/migrations/<version>.md` is the documented upgrade path, but
# nothing forced a guide to exist: the only automated check keyed off a
# `### Breaking` CHANGELOG heading this repo has never written, so it never
# fired -- 0.6.0 shipped the `with_pool` -> `with_pool_untracked` rename with
# no mention in any guide. This script makes the guide a release *gate*.
#
# It enforces four things over CHANGELOG.md:
#
#   1. Marker convention. A breaking entry is declared either with the inline
#      token `**Breaking:**` (any case) or by sitting under a
#      `### Breaking Changes` heading. Nothing else counts.
#   2. Unmarked-break lint. An entry that talks about *breaking* something
#      without the marker fails, unless the wording is explicitly negated
#      ("non-breaking", "no breaking change", "without breaking ...") or the
#      entry carries an explicit suppression comment. Without this, an author
#      can strand users by writing prose the coverage check cannot see -- which
#      is exactly how 0.6.0's rename slipped through.
#   3. Coverage. A section with at least one breaking entry must have a guide:
#      `docs/migrations/<version>.md` for a release, `docs/migrations/next.md`
#      (the rolling draft, renamed at release time) for `## [Unreleased]`.
#      A release candidate (`## [0.7.0-rc.1]`) is gated against its release's
#      guide, `docs/migrations/0.7.0.md`.
#   4. Linkage. Every breaking entry must carry a markdown *link* to its own
#      guide -- `](docs/migrations/X.Y.Z.md)` -- so a reader lands on the fix
#      path straight from the changelog line. A bare path mention is not a link.
#
# It also checks every guide in `docs/migrations/` for the TEMPLATE.md shape
# (required headings, each with content under it, and the recorded guide-only
# upgrade walk-through, which may only be `pending` on the rolling draft) and
# for an entry in the `docs/migrations/README.md` index, so a stub that only
# exists to satisfy check 3 does not pass.
#
# Releases before $MIGRATION_GUIDE_FLOOR are out of scope (issue #1588
# explicitly excludes backfilling guides earlier than 0.4.0).
#
# The gate FAILS CLOSED on anything it cannot read: a `## ` heading it cannot
# parse and an unclosed code fence are both hard errors, because either one
# silently removes whole sections from every check above.
#
# Residual risk, stated plainly: the lint is textual. An author who describes a
# break without using the word "breaking" and without the marker still gets
# through. Reviewers remain the backstop; this gate removes the *silent*
# failure mode, it does not replace judgement.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-migration-guides.sh          # gate (exit 1 on any finding)
#   scripts/check-migration-guides.sh --list   # inventory, no enforcement

# Byte semantics for every awk below, and identical behaviour on every

#   awk: towc: multibyte conversion failure on: '<byte>'
#
# CHANGELOG.md contains an en dash ("2-4 weeks" written with U+2013), so the

# Shared markdown state machine, injected into every awk program below.
#
# awk has no include, and this script runs three separate awk processes over
# three different files. Hand-maintaining a copy of these rules in each is what
# produced this gate's whole tail of review findings: a fix would land in one
# parser and not its sibling, or land without the fail-closed guard the sibling
# already had. One text, three programs, no drift.

# visible_text(line) returns what a reader actually sees on that line, and
# maintains fence and comment state across calls. Order matters and is the
# point: a fenced body is literal, so it is never scanned for HTML comment
# delimiters — an example that merely *shows* `<!--` must not comment out the
# document. Callers read these globals after each call:
#   md_fence_hit   this line is a fence delimiter
#   md_in_fence    we are inside a fenced block
#   md_in_comment  we are inside an HTML comment
#   md_in_html_block / md_html_type  we are inside a raw HTML block, and which

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Check 5: codemod coverage (issue #1629).
#
# #1588 made the guide a gate; this makes the *automation* a gate. Every
# breaking entry in a guide -- each `### ` section under `## Breaking changes`
# -- declares how much of it a machine can apply, with a one-word confidence
# label that a reader and this script both understand:
#
#   **Automation:** `auto`   -- `autumn upgrade` rewrites every call site.
#   **Automation:** `review` -- it rewrites, and flags each site for a human.
#   **Automation:** `manual` -- no rewrite; this guide section is the fix path.
#
# Four things are enforced:
#
#   1. Classification where it is load-bearing. A rename-level entry -- the
#      class `autumn upgrade` can apply -- must carry a label; shipping one
#      unclassified is the exact failure issue #1629 exists to prevent. That
#      *every* breaking entry in this repository's guides carries a label is
#      asserted separately, over the real guides as a set, by the
#      `upgrade_codemod` test suite in autumn-cli.
#
#      Entries are read under *every* `## ` section, not only
#      `## Breaking changes`: a rename documented under `## Behavior changes`
#      or `## Configuration changes` breaks apps exactly as hard, and scoping
#      the scan to one heading let it through. `### Guide-only upgrade
#      walkthrough` is the one `### ` that is never an entry.
#   2. The codemod exists. An `auto`/`review` entry must name a migration id
#      that is actually shipped in the registry ($CODEMOD_REGISTRY). A guide
#      promising a codemod nobody wrote is worse than no promise.
#   3. Rename-level changes justify staying manual. A rename or an import move
#      is the class `autumn upgrade` can apply safely, so `manual` there needs
#      a stated reason. Semantic and behavioural changes need no justification:
#      the label alone is the whole answer for them.
#   4. Codemod-first walk-through. A released guide that ships an `auto`/
#      `review` codemod records a `- **Codemod:**` line under
#      `### Guide-only upgrade walkthrough`, because #1629 requires the
#      per-release walk-through to run `autumn upgrade` before any manual step.
#
# Rename detection is textual, like the unmarked-break lint above, and it
# deliberately errs toward *over*-detecting: a false positive costs the author
# one sentence of justification, while a false negative is a release that
# strands users on a hand-edit the tool could have done. Negations are not
# special-cased for that reason.
#
# The registry is read as text rather than by building the CLI, so this stays a
# lint-job-speed check. A missing registry file reads as "no codemods shipped",
# which makes the gate stricter (every `auto`/`review` claim fails), never
# laxer.
#
# An entry carrying the `<!-- migration-guide-gate: <reason> -->` suppression
# (the same one check 1 reads) is exempt from all four, so an entry that merely
# *documents* the convention does not have to satisfy it. Like every use of
# that token it is greppable and shows up in the diff.
#
# Residual risk, stated plainly: a breaking change written as prose with no
# `### ` heading of its own -- including one written as a setext heading -- is
# not an entry here, so it is not classified. TEMPLATE.md gives every change its
# own ATX heading; reviewers remain the backstop.
