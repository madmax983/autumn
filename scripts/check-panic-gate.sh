#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Verify that every canonical request-path module still carries the #1611
# panic-free gate header. The header opts each module into the panic-class
# clippy denials (unwrap/expect/panic/unreachable/todo/unimplemented/
# indexing_slicing/string_slice/arithmetic_side_effects) on the production code
# path via `cfg_attr(not(test), …)`.
#
# This script guards the *manifest and the header shape*, and — crucially — the
# absence of any module-wide escape hatch that would let a production panic ship
# while `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` stays green. The actual panic detection is
# performed by clippy in the same `lint` job; this script keeps that clippy run
# able to see the denials in the first place.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. Every manifest module exists and carries the `autumn-panic-gate:` marker.
#   2. The marker is IMMEDIATELY followed (blank/comment lines aside) by the
#      `#![cfg_attr(` gate header, and THAT block is the one validated.
#   3. STRUCTURAL header shape: after stripping `//` and `/* … */` comments and all whitespace,
#      the header must open EXACTLY `#![cfg_attr(not(test),deny(` — a widened
#      predicate like `all(not(test), any())` (whose deny never compiles) or a
#      `not(test)` that lives only in a comment therefore fail. The block must
#      carry no `allow(`/`expect(`/`warn(` of its own, and must list every lint
#      in REQUIRED_PANIC_LINTS (the COMPLETE set, not a subset).
#   4. Tree-wide inner-suppression scan: NO inner attribute (`#![allow(…)]` or
#      `#![expect(…)]`, including the `cfg_attr(…, allow(…))` form) anywhere under
#      the scan roots may re-permit a required lint OR a blanket lint group
#      (`clippy::restriction|all|pedantic|nursery`). This runs over EVERY `*.rs`
#      under the roots — not just manifest entries — so an unmarked submodule of a
#      gated module cannot slip a module-wide allow past both the manifest and the
#      reverse-manifest check. Attributes inside a `#[cfg(test)]` scope are
#      exempt (that is where a gated module's own tests legitimately allow them).
#   5. Per-site allow hygiene: an OUTER `#[allow(<required lint>…)]` in a gated
#      module must carry a NON-EMPTY `reason = "…"`.
#   6. Reverse manifest: every marker-carrying `*.rs` under the scan roots must be
#      listed in the manifest (closes the in-file-gated-but-unlisted drift hole).
#   7. Module-count floor: the manifest may not shrink below MODULE_COUNT_FLOOR.
#   8. Feature reachability: a module gated behind a non-default Cargo feature must
#      have that feature enabled by an ENFORCING ci.yml clippy lane (one that is
#      not commented out and carries both `-p autumn-web` and `-D warnings`),
#      otherwise its deny block is never compiled. The single knowing exception
#      (telemetry-otlp) is declared in FEATURE_LINT_EXEMPT and announced on every
#      run; that list is itself validated so it cannot rot into a silent hole.
#
# NOT covered (documented in CONTRIBUTING.md "Request-path panic gate"): panics
# that reach a gated module only through a `macro_rules!` expansion, because
# clippy suppresses lints inside macro expansions and no source-level gate can
# see them. Request-path modules must not invoke panic-expanding local macros.
#
# Called from the `lint` job in ci.yml. Run locally with:
#
#     ./scripts/check-panic-gate.sh              # self-test, then the real check
#     ./scripts/check-panic-gate.sh --self-test  # synthetic fixtures only
#     ./scripts/check-panic-gate.sh --check-only # real tree only
#
# The default invocation runs the self-test FIRST so a refactor that silently
# defangs this script fails here rather than years later on a real regression.
# Both legs together run in a couple of seconds — no toolchain, no network
# (the `--check-only` real pass alone is about a second and a half).

# Canonical request-path module set, as `<path>:<cargo feature>`. Every file

# header. Keep this list in sync with CONTRIBUTING.md "Request-path panic gate".
#
# The `<cargo feature>` suffix is the feature that gates the module's `mod`
# declaration (verified against `autumn/src/lib.rs` and the relevant `mod.rs`
# files, NOT guessed): it drives the feature-reachability check below. Use
# `default` for a module compiled by a plain `cargo clippy --workspace` — that
# includes `autumn-search`, a separate always-built crate. A feature named here
# that is part of `autumn`'s `default` feature set (e.g. `db`) also counts as
# reachable; if it ever leaves the default set, the plain workspace clippy stops
# compiling the module and this check starts demanding an explicit CI feature.
#
# Suffix syntax rather than a parallel array on purpose: a path and its feature
# cannot drift apart when they live in one token.
