# Verify that every publishable crate's manifest is valid and all referenced
# source files exist, without uploading to crates.io.
#
# Uses `cargo package --list` which enumerates the files that would be included
# in the .crate archive.  This catches: missing files referenced from Cargo.toml,
# broken include/exclude patterns, and manifest parse errors — without attempting
# registry dependency resolution.
#
# NOTE: We intentionally avoid `cargo package --no-verify` here because that
# command rewrites local path dependencies to their pinned registry versions and
# resolves them against crates.io.  Plugin crates (autumn-admin-plugin,
# autumn-storage-s3, autumn-cache-redis) depend on autumn-web features that are
# only present in the workspace but not yet in the published autumn-web on
# crates.io at the time this gate runs, which causes false failures.
# `check-crate-metadata.sh` already verifies inter-crate version pin alignment;
# the packaging step here focuses on file and manifest integrity.
#
# Called from the `publish-gate` workflow. Run locally with:
#
#     ./scripts/check-publish-dry-run.sh
