# Build-and-boot gate for the generated `autumn release init` image (issue #978).
#
# `autumn release init` scaffolds a production Dockerfile and docs/guide/deployment.md
# makes a falsifiable promise: "from a fresh `autumn new` project to a
# production-shaped container running... under 10 minutes", with `/health` wired
# as the container HEALTHCHECK. The existing tests only string-assert Dockerfile
# *contents*; nothing ever runs `docker build` on the generated image and boots
# it. This harness closes that loop: it scaffolds a fresh project, runs
# `autumn release init --force`, builds the generated image, runs the documented
# one-shot `autumn migrate` job against a throwaway Postgres, boots the web
# container, and asserts GET /health and /actuator/health both return 200 within
# a bounded startup window. It also covers the `--target docker-compose` path,
# bringing the stack up and tearing it down cleanly.
#
# The `https` target extends the same loop to direct in-process TLS (issue
# #1603): the app terminates HTTPS itself from `[server.tls]`, with no reverse
# proxy in the picture, and the gate proves the image boots that way and answers
# an HTTPS health check with a real (test) certificate.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-release-image-boot.sh [default|docker-compose|https]
#
# Environment:
#   AUTUMN_BIN             Path to a prebuilt `autumn` binary. When unset, the
#                         script builds `autumn-cli` from the current checkout so
#                         the gate verifies the scaffold produced by *this* tree.
#   PG_HOST / PG_PORT     Postgres host/port for the bare `default` target's
#                         one-shot migrate + boot (default: localhost / 5432).
#                         In CI this is a service container mapped to localhost.
#   PG_USER / PG_PASSWORD Postgres credentials (default: autumn / autumn).
#   STARTUP_BUDGET_SECS   Health-probe deadline after boot (default: 30) — the
#                         documented "≤ 30s after boot" window.
#   IMAGE_SIZE_BUDGET_MB  Runtime image size budget for the secondary guard
#                         (default: 150). Reported informationally; exceeding it
#                         warns rather than fails (optional per the spec).
#   HEALTHY_BUDGET_SECS   Deadline for the container's own Docker HEALTHCHECK to
#                         report `healthy` in the `https` target (default: 120).
#                         The generated HEALTHCHECK has a 10s start period and a
#                         30s interval, so this needs headroom over the probe
#                         budget above.
