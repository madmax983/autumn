# Validate that the workspace version, CHANGELOG.md, and release tag all agree
# on whether the release is patch, minor, or breaking before the gate passes.
#
# Checks performed:
#   1. The workspace version in Cargo.toml matches the release tag (if set).
#   2. CHANGELOG.md has an entry for the current workspace version.
#   3. If the release is a breaking change (MAJOR or pre-1.0 minor bump), a
#      matching migration guide stub exists under docs/migrations/.
#   4. If the release is NOT a breaking change, CHANGELOG.md must not contain
#      "Breaking" entries under the current version heading.
#
# The RELEASE_TAG env var is set automatically in CI (github.ref_name).
# When run locally without a tag, steps that require a tag are skipped.
#
# Called from the `publish-gate` workflow. Run locally with:
#
#     ./scripts/check-release-notes.sh
#     RELEASE_TAG=v0.4.0 ./scripts/check-release-notes.sh
