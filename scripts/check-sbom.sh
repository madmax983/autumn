# Generate the workspace SBOM and prove it describes the tagged source tree.
#
# This is the executable half of issue #1615's first acceptance criterion.
# Generating an SBOM in CI and then attaching it is not, by itself, a gate: the
# job that produced the file would always agree with itself. What makes it a
# gate is that the file is:
#
#   1. Regenerated from this checkout and compared component-by-component
#      (`autumn sbom --verify`), which proves the generator is deterministic —
#      the property `--verify` depends on everywhere else. The gate that
#      catches a stale or substituted document is the SAME `--verify` run
#      again in publish-gate.yml's `prepare-release`, against the artifact
#      after it has travelled; this script produces the file that gate checks.
#   2. Checked to describe the version actually being released: `--expect-version`
#      makes the CLI assert its root component equals [workspace.package].version,
#      and this script separately requires that version to equal RELEASE_TAG
#      when one is set (as on a tag push).
#   3. `--locked`, so a Cargo.lock that does not match the manifests is a gate
#      failure rather than a silently different dependency set.
#
# Writes the verified SBOM to $SBOM_OUT (default sbom.cdx.json) for the
# release job to attach and attest.
#
# Called from the `publish-gate` workflow. Run locally with:
#
#     ./scripts/check-sbom.sh
#     RELEASE_TAG=v0.8.0 ./scripts/check-sbom.sh
