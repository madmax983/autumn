    # autumn-web special case: run TWO explicit-feature passes — one over the
    # crate's documented Postgres public-API surface and one over the SQLite
    # backend — with cargo-semver-checks' "enable (almost) all features"
    # heuristic disabled. The two DB backends are mutually exclusive at the
    # type level (see below), so neither pass alone covers the whole surface
    # and they cannot be merged into one.
    #
    # Why: as of 0.6.0 autumn-web gained the mutually-incompatible feature pair
    # `sqlite` × `managed-pg`/`managed-pg-bundled`. `sqlite` flips the
    # `db::RuntimeConnection` type alias to a SQLite connection, while
    # `managed_pg.rs` hard-codes `AsyncPgConnection` against the Postgres
    # `RuntimeConnection` — so co-enabling them is a TYPE-LEVEL incompatibility
    # that fails rustdoc with E0308/E0271. Left unconstrained, the tool's
    # all-features heuristic co-enables exactly that pair, the rustdoc build
    # cargo-semver-checks needs fails to compile, and the tool exits 1 with
    # compile-error output — tripping this script's catch-all tool-failure
    # branch and hard-blocking a tag-push release, even though the semver API
    # check itself is clean.
    #
    # `--only-explicit-features --features <list>` pins the feature set to a
    # fully deterministic, compilable posture so the heuristic can never
    # co-enable `sqlite`+`managed-pg-bundled`. `--only-explicit-features`
    # disables the "enable (almost) all features" heuristic, so ONLY the
    # `--features` list is enabled (the crate's default feature set is a subset
    # of that list and contains neither `sqlite` nor `managed-pg`, so the
    # incompatible pair can never be co-enabled):
    #   1. The list is the crate's own documented API posture (Postgres `db`),
    #      and EXCLUDES `sqlite`/`managed-pg`/`managed-pg-bundled`, so rustdoc
    #      compiles.
    #   2. It is baseline-safe: every feature in the list already exists in the
    #      published 0.5.x crates.io baseline, so the symmetric enable on both
    #      baseline and current builds cleanly.
    #
    # The list = the STABILITY.md stable public-API feature surface INTERSECTED
    # with the published baseline's `[features]` keys — i.e. the MAXIMAL
    # baseline-safe coverage. Recomputed for the 0.7.0 release: 0.6.0 is now
    # the crates.io baseline, so `tls`, `acme`, `offline-sync` and
    # `embed-assets` — 0.6.0-only when this list was last computed, and
    # therefore excluded then — are intersection-eligible and have been ADDED. This deliberately supersedes the earlier
    # docs.rs-only list, which silently DROPPED feature-gated public modules that
    # already exist in the 0.5.0 baseline (e.g. `presence`, `webauthn`,
    # `inbound-mail`/`inbound-mailgun`/`inbound-ses`, `telemetry-otlp`) — so a
    # breaking change behind any of those would have passed the tag gate
    # unnoticed. STABILITY.md ("Feature flags") makes every non-`unstable-*`
    # feature part of the public API, so all of them are restored here.
    #
    # It cannot equal either set alone: cargo-semver-checks enables `--features`
    # symmetrically on the 0.6.0 baseline build too, so any feature the baseline
    # lacks would error there.
    #   - Recomputed for the 0.8.0 release: 0.7.0 is now the crates.io baseline,
    #     so `sim-testing`, `pdf` and `edge` — new in 0.7.0, and excluded for
    #     that reason while 0.6.0 was the baseline — are intersection-eligible
    #     and have been ADDED.
    #   - EXCLUDES the 0.8.0-only features `collab`, `sla`, `constela`,
    #     `plugin-sandbox` and `acme-pebble`: all are NEW in 0.8.0 and absent
    #     from the 0.7.0 baseline, so the symmetric enable would fail the
    #     baseline build ("v0.7.0 does not have feature ...") and re-break the
    #     gate. Add each once a future baseline carries it — the same rule that
    #     gated `sim-testing`/`pdf`/`edge` out of the previous revision.
    #   - EXCLUDES `sqlite`, which IS baseline-present in 0.6.0, because it
    #     flips `db::RuntimeConnection` to a SQLite connection and is therefore
    #     type-incompatible with the Postgres surface this pass covers. It is
    #     no longer dropped silently: the dedicated sqlite-vs-sqlite pass below
    #     covers it symmetrically.
    #   - EXCLUDES `managed-pg`/`managed-pg-bundled`, also baseline-present,
    #     for the same STABILITY.md "Unsupported feature combinations (CI
    #     excluded)" reason as `system-tests`/`test-support` below (they
    #     download or embed Postgres binaries). Keeping them out ALSO keeps the
    #     DB-backend type-incompatible pair `sqlite` × `managed-pg` from ever
    #     being co-enabled — the E0271 rustdoc failure this special-case
    #     originally fixed — now that the intersection no longer drops them
    #     automatically.
    #   - EXCLUDES `system-tests` and `test-support` even though both ARE in the
    #     0.5.0 baseline: STABILITY.md's "Unsupported feature combinations (CI
    #     excluded)" table names both (alongside `managed-pg`/`managed-pg-bundled`)
    #     as "not checked in CI because their build requirements make them
    #     cost-prohibitive or unsuitable for standard runners" (`system-tests`
    #     pulls a headless-Chromium `chromiumoxide`; `test-support` is dev-only
    #     and pulls Docker-dependent `testcontainers`). The semver gate is itself
    #     a CI feature-combination check on a standard runner, so aligning its
    #     excluded set with that table is a defensible, STABILITY.md-grounded
    #     carve-out — and it keeps the release gate from building chromiumoxide
    #     twice (current + baseline). `telemetry-otlp`, by contrast, is in
    #     STABILITY.md's CHECKED representative-combinations table, so it stays IN.
    #
    # Maintenance: this list is PINNED to `SEMVER_ALLOWLIST_TARGET_VERSION`
    # (below) — the autumn-web version it was hand-computed for. Expand it as the
    # published baseline advances: a feature that is 0.6.0-only today becomes
    # intersection-eligible the moment a baseline release (0.6.x) carries it. The
    # version tripwire immediately below the maintenance note `die`s for any
    # autumn-web version other than the pinned target, so a version bump can never
    # silently ship this static list against a newer baseline that already carries
    # tls/acme/sqlite/managed-pg/embed-assets/offline-sync (a breaking change
    # behind those would otherwise pass the tag gate unnoticed) — the maintainer
    # is forced to recompute the intersection (and add the deferred
    # sqlite-vs-sqlite pass, see below) before the target is bumped.
    #
    # The sqlite-vs-sqlite pass, deferred at 0.6.0, is now ADDED (see
    # `autumn_web_semver_sqlite_features` below). It was deferred because the
    # 0.5.x baseline had no `sqlite` feature, so a symmetric enable would
    # hard-error on the baseline, while a sqlite-vs-Postgres comparison yields
    # false-positive breaks because `sqlite` flips `RuntimeConnection`'s type.
    # 0.6.0 carries `sqlite`, so an apples-to-apples symmetric enable is finally
    # possible and the SQLite public surface is no longer unchecked.
    #
    # NOTE: `telemetry-otlp` pulls prost/tonic, which need `protoc` at build
    # time. The SemVer job in .github/workflows/publish-gate.yml installs
    # protobuf-compiler for this reason — keep them in sync.
    #
    # TRIPWIRE (baseline-drift guard): the allowlist above is a static, hand-
    # computed intersection valid ONLY while cargo-semver-checks compares the
    # current build against the 0.5.x crates.io baseline. It is pinned to the
    # autumn-web version it was computed for. Fail LOUDLY for any other version
    # so a future release cannot silently under-cover features that are present
    # in a newer (0.6.x+) baseline but still omitted here. autumn-web inherits
    # the `[workspace.package]` version, so its "current" version for
    # cargo-semver-checks is exactly `workspace_package_value "version"` — parsed
