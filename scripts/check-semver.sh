# Uses `cargo-semver-checks` (https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks).
# The tool is installed automatically if not already present.
#
# Patch and minor releases fail if any public API break is detected.
# Intentional breaking releases (major bumps, or pre-1.0 minor bumps) pass
# the gate automatically when a migration guide exists at
# docs/migrations/<version>.md — the presence of the guide is proof that the
# break is documented and acknowledged.
#
# Called from the `publish-gate` workflow. Run locally with:
