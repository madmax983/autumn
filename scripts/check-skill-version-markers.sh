# Verify the `autumn-web` agent skill's version markers against CHANGELOG.md.
#
# The skill annotates APIs with the release they arrived in — "(0.6.0)",
# "**(0.7.0)**", "(0.7.0, #1182)", "(feature `tls`, 0.6.0, #1603)", and more.
# A marker that names too NEW a release is the damaging direction: it tells a
# reader on that line an API is out of reach when it already shipped.
#
# These markers were hand-maintained and drifted badly across the 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0
# cut, in several punctuation shapes that ad-hoc greps kept missing. This script
# matches the version token itself rather than any surrounding punctuation, so a
# new shape cannot hide from it.
#
# Method: for a marker line that also cites an issue (`#1234`), find that
# issue's OLDEST mention in CHANGELOG.md — the file is newest-first, so the
# oldest mention is the release that introduced it — and require the marker to
# name that release. Lines with no issue reference are reported as unverifiable
# and must be checked by hand.

# bans the specific phrasings rather than trying to interpret them. Say when a
# feature ARRIVED ("since 0.6.0", "(0.6.0)"), never where it has not yet landed.
