# Verify that no workspace manifest enables autumn-web's `sqlite` feature
# through a dependency edge (issue #1905 / #2539 §3).
#
# WHAT THE INVARIANT IS
#   `sqlite` is a BACKEND-FLIP feature: it swaps `db::RuntimeConnection` from
#   `AsyncPgConnection` to `SyncConnectionWrapper<SqliteConnection>`. Cargo
#   feature unification is global, so ONE edge — `autumn-web = { …, features =
#   ["sqlite"] }` in any crate or dev-dependency, or a feature that forwards
#   `autumn-web/sqlite` — flips the connection type for EVERY consumer in the
#   graph and breaks the Postgres default build. The feature is meant to be
#   turned on only by an end application or an explicit `--features sqlite`
#   invocation.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT
#   Until now the invariant was prose (autumn/Cargo.toml, autumn/src/db.rs), a
#   `sqlite`-excluding feature list in ci.yml, and review. Nothing read the
#   manifests. A dev-dependency added tomorrow would surface only if some
#   Postgres-assuming crate happened to fail to compile in a lane that runs —
#   and `scripts/pre-push-check.sh` skips the sqlite lane entirely.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS  (every `Cargo.toml` in the tree, `target/` aside)
#   1. No dependency, dev-dependency or build-dependency edge on `autumn-web`
#      or `autumn-cli` enables `sqlite`. Covers the inline form
#      (`autumn-web = { features = ["sqlite"] }`), the section form
#      (`[dev-dependencies.autumn-web]` + `features = [...]`), the dotted-key
#      form (`autumn-web.features = [...]`) and a renamed dependency in any of
#      its three spellings (`web = { package = "autumn-web", … }`,
#      `[dependencies.web]` + `package = "autumn-web"`, `web.package = "…"`) —
#      a rename splits the crate name away from the `features` list, so the
#      manifest is read twice and the aliases resolved before the rules run.
#   2. No `[features]` entry enables `autumn-web/sqlite` / `autumn-cli/sqlite`,
#      directly OR transitively through local feature aliases
#      (`default = ["embedded"]`, `embedded = ["sqlite"]`): pass 1 builds the
#      local feature graph, and pass 2 rejects any feature other than `sqlite`
#      itself that reaches the flip, reporting the path that got there. The
#      only exception is an entry ITSELF named `sqlite` in a manifest
#      belonging to one of those two crates — autumn-cli's own opt-in backend
#      (`sqlite = ["autumn-web/sqlite", …]`), selected the same explicit way
#      autumn-web's is. The same line in any other crate is an edge wearing
#      the exception as a name, and a `default` that reaches the flip through
#      any number of hops is the one-hop `default = ["sqlite"]` case with the
#      middlemen left in.
#   3. (Folded into 2: `default` is one more node in the feature graph, so a
#      bare, forwarded, or chained `default` is caught by the same rule.)
#
# It is a manifest gate, not a build: no toolchain, ~1 second, self-testing.
#
# Deliberately scans EVERY `Cargo.toml` under the root, including crates the
# root workspace excludes (fuzz targets, benchmark harnesses, `src-tauri`).
# Those cannot unify with the main graph, so the rule does not strictly apply
# there — but a manifest moving in or out of the workspace is a one-line edit,
# and a gate that followed `members` would silently stop covering a crate on
# that edit. Erring toward scanning costs a false positive nobody has hit;
# erring the other way costs the invariant.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-sqlite-unification.sh              # self-test, then check
#   ./scripts/check-sqlite-unification.sh --self-test  # self-test only
#   ./scripts/check-sqlite-unification.sh --check-only  # check only
