# Shared changelog-fragment reading.
#
# A release note used to go straight into `CHANGELOG.md`, at the top of the
# `## [Unreleased]` section. Every open PR wrote to those same few lines, so
# every PR conflicted with every other PR, and the conflict was never about
# the code. A note now goes into its own file under `changelog.d/`, which two
# PRs cannot both edit. `scripts/update-changelog.sh` folds the files into
# `CHANGELOG.md` at release time.
#
# The gates that read the Unreleased section — the migration-guide gate and
# the plugin-freshness gate — must see a note on the day the PR lands, not
# only at release. `changelog_view` gives them that: `CHANGELOG.md` with every
# fragment spliced into the Unreleased section. The fragments are the same
# markdown the section holds, so each gate parses the view with the parser it
# already has.
#
# This file only defines functions. Sourcing it has no side effects.
#
#   source scripts/lib/changelog.sh
#   changelog_view                # the working tree
#   changelog_view "$merge_base"  # the same view at a git revision
