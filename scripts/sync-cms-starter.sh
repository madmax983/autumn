# Regenerate `autumn-cli/src/starters/cms` from `examples/cms`.
#
# The two trees are pinned byte-for-byte by `embedded_cms_matches_example_cms`
# in `autumn-cli/src/starters/mod.rs`, modulo two files the starter does not
# ship as-is:
#
#   Cargo.toml            -- the starter ships `Cargo.toml.tmpl` instead, with a
#                            versioned `autumn-web` dependency rather than the
#                            in-workspace path one the example needs.
#   tests/system/smoke.rs -- workspace-internal e2e tooling (issue #1192); it
#                            depends on the path-only `example-e2e` crate and
#                            has no meaning outside this monorepo.
#
# `static/css/app.css` is a Tailwind build artefact and is skipped too.
#
# Workflow: edit `examples/cms`, run `cargo fmt`, then run this. The drift test
# fails loudly if you forget.
#
# Written in bash rather than Python on purpose: `.gitignore` ignores `*.py`,
# so a Python helper here would never be committed and this script would be
# broken for everyone but its author.
